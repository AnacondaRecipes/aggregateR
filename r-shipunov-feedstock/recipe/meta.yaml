  summary: 'A collection of functions for data manipulation, plotting and statistical computing,
    to use separately or with the book "Visual Statistics. Use R!": Shipunov (2020)
    <http://ashipunov.info/shipunov/software/r/r-en.htm>. Most useful functions: Bclust(),
    Jclust() and BootA() which bootstrap hierarchical clustering; Recode() which does
    multiple recoding in a fast, simple and flexible way; Misclass() which outputs confusion
    matrix even if classes are not concerted; Overlap() which measures group separation
    on any projection; Biarrows() which converts any scatterplot into biplot; and Pleiad()
    which is fast and flexible correlogram.'
