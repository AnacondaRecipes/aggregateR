  summary: 'A collection of functions for data manipulation, plotting and statistical computing,
    to use separately or with the book "Visual Statistics. Use R!": Shipunov (2020)
    <http://ashipunov.info/shipunov/software/r/r-en.htm>. Dr Alexey Shipunov died in
    December 2022. Most useful functions: Bclust(), Jclust() and BootA() which bootstrap
    hierarchical clustering; Recode() which does multiple recoding in a fast, simple
    and flexible way; Misclass() which outputs confusion matrix even if classes are
    not concerted; Overlap() which measures group separation on any projection; Biarrows()
    which converts any scatterplot into biplot; and Pleiad() which is fast and flexible
    correlogram.'
