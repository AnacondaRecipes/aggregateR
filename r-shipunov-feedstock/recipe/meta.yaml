  summary: 'A collection of functions for data manipulation, plotting and statistical computing,
    to use separately or with the book "Visual Statistics. Use R!": Shipunov (2019)
    <http://ashipunov.info/shipunov/software/r/r-en.htm>. Most useful functions are
    probably Bclust(), Jclust() and BootA() which bootstrap hierarchical clustering;
    Recode...() which multiple recode in a fast, flexible and simple way; Misclass()
    which outputs confusion matrix even if classes are not concerted; Overlap() which
    calculates overlaps of convex hulls from any projection; and Pleiad() which is fast
    and flexible correlogram. In fact, there are much more useful functions, please
    see documentation.'
