  summary: If a procedure consists of several stages and there are several models that can be
    selected for each stage, uncertainty of the procedure can be decomposed by stages
    or models. This package includes the ANOVA-based method, the cumulative uncertainty-based
    method, and the balanced decomposition method. Yongdai Kim et al. (2019) <doi:10.1016/j.hydroa.2019.100024>
