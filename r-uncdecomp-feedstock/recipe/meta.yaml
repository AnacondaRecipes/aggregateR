  summary: If a procedure consists of several stages and there are several scenarios that can
    be selected for each stage, uncertainty of the procedure can be decomposed by stages
    or scenarios. cum_uncertainty() is used to decompose uncertainty based on the cumulative
    uncertainty. stage_uncertainty() and scenario_uncertainty() is used to decompose
    uncertainty based on the second order interaction ANOVA model. In stage_uncertainty()
    and scenario_uncertainty(), the uncertainty from interaction effect from two stages
    is distributed equally to each stage.
