  summary: 'Multilevel ecological data series (MEDS) are sequences of observations ordered according
    to temporal/spatial hierarchies that are defined by sample designs, with sample
    variability confined to ecological factors. Dendroclimatic MEDS of tree rings and
    climate are modeled into normalized fluctuations of tree growth and aridity.  Modeled
    fluctuations (model frames) are compared with Mantel correlograms on multiple levels
    defined by sample design. Package implementation can be understood by running examples
    in modelFrame(), and muleMan() functions. '
