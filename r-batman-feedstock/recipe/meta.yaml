  summary: Survey systems and other third-party data sources commonly use non-standard representations
    of logical values when it comes to qualitative data - "Yes", "No" and "N/A", say.
    batman is a package designed to seamlessly convert these into logicals. It is highly
    localised, and contains equivalents to boolean values in languages including German,
    French, Spanish, Italian, Turkish, Chinese and Polish.
