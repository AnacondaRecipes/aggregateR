  summary: A collection of (wrapper) functions the creator found useful for quickly placing data
    summaries and formatted regression results into '.Rnw' or '.Rmd' files. Functions
    for generating commonly used graphics, such as receiver operating curves or Bland-Altman
    plots, are also provided by 'qwraps2'.  'qwraps2' is a updated version of a package
    'qwraps'. The original version 'qwraps' was never submitted to CRAN but can be found
    at <https://github.com/dewittpe/qwraps/>. The implementation and limited scope of
    the functions within 'qwraps2' <https://github.com/dewittpe/qwraps2/> is fundamentally
    different from 'qwraps'.
