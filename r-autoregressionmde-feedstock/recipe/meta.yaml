  summary: Consider autoregressive model of order p where the distribution function of innovation
    is unknown, but innovations are independent and symmetrically distributed. The package
    contains a function named ARMDE which takes X (vector of n observations) and p (order
    of the model) as input argument and returns minimum distance estimator of the parameters
    in the model.
