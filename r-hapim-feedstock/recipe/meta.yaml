  summary: The package provides a set of functions whose aim is to propose 4 methods of QTL detection.
    HAPimLD is an interval-mapping method designed for unrelated individuals with no
    family information that makes use of linkage disequilibrium. HAPimLDL is an interval-mapping
    method for design of half-sib families. It combines linkage analysis and linkage
    disequilibrium. HaploMax is based on an analysis of variance with a dose haplotype
    effect. HaploMaxHS is based on an analysis of variance with a sire effect and a
    dose haplotype effect in half-sib family design.  Fundings for the package development
    were provided to the LDLmapQTL project by the ANR GENANIMAL program and APIS-GENE.
