  summary: Tools to help text files importation. It can return  the number of lines; print the
    first and last lines; convert  encoding. Operations are made without reading the
    entire file  before starting, resulting in good performances with large files.  This
    package provides an alternative to a simple use of the  'head', 'tail', 'wc' and
    'iconv' programs that are not always  available on machine where R is installed.
