  summary: Differential geometric least angle regression method for fitting sparse generalized
    linear models. In this version of the package, the user can fit models specifying
    Gaussian, Poisson, Binomial, Gamma and Inverse Gaussian family. Furthermore, several
    link functions can be used to model the relationship between the conditional expected
    value of the response variable and the linear predictor. The solution curve can
    be computed using an efficient predictor-corrector or a cyclic coordinate descent
    algorithm, as described in the paper linked to via the URL below.
