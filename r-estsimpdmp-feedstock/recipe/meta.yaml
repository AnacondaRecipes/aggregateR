  summary: This package deals with the estimation of the jump rate for piecewise-deterministic
    Markov processes (PDMPs), from only one observation of the process within a long
    time. The main functions provide an estimate of this function. The state space may
    be discrete or continuous. The associated paper has been published in Scandinavian
    Journal of Statistics and is given in references. Other functions provide a method
    to simulate random variables from their (conditional) hazard rate, and then to simulate
    PDMPs.
