  summary: Resampling Stats (http://www.resample.com) is an add-in for running randomization
    tests in Excel worksheets. The workflow is (1) to define a statistic of interest
    that can be calculated from a data table, (2) to randomize rows ad/or columns of
    a data table to simulate a null hypothesis and (3) and to score the value of the
    statistic from many randomizations. The relative frequency distribution of the statistic
    in the simulations is then used to infer the probability of the observed value be
    generated by the null process (probability of Type I error). This package intends
    to translate this logic for R for teaching purposes. Keeping the original workflow
    is favored over performance.
