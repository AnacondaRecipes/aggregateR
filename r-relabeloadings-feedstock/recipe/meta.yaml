  summary: In confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), structural constraints typically ensure that
    the model is identified up to all possible reflections, i.e., column sign changes
    of the matrix of loadings. Such reflection invariance is problematic for Bayesian
    CFA when the reflection modes are not well separated in the posterior distribution.
    Imposing rotational constraints -- fixing some loadings to be zero or positive in
    order to pick a factor solution that corresponds to one reflection mode -- may not
    provide a satisfactory solution for Bayesian CFA. The function 'relabel' uses the
    relabeling algorithm of Erosheva and Curtis to correct for sign invariance in MCMC
    draws from CFA models. The MCMC draws should come from Bayesian CFA models that
    are fit without rotational constraints.
