  summary: A set of wrappers around 'rjags' functions to run Bayesian analyses in 'JAGS' (specifically,
    via 'libjags').  A single function call can control adaptive, burn-in, and sampling
    MCMC phases, with MCMC chains run in sequence or in parallel. Posterior distributions
    are automatically summarized (with the ability to exclude some monitored nodes if
    desired) and functions are available to generate figures based on the posteriors
    (e.g., predictive check plots, traceplots). Function inputs, argument syntax, and
    output format are nearly identical to the 'R2WinBUGS'/'R2OpenBUGS' packages to allow
    easy switching between MCMC samplers.
