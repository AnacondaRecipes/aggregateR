  summary: Combining a generalized linear model with an additional tree part on the same scale.
    A four-step procedure is proposed to fit the model and test the joint effect of
    the selected tree part while adjusting on confounding factors. We also proposed
    an ensemble procedure based on the bagging to improve prediction accuracy and computed
    several scores of importance for variable selection. See 'Cyprien Mbogning et al.'(2014)<doi:10.1186/2043-9113-4-6>

    the methods implemented in this package.
