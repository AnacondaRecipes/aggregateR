  summary: Combining a generalized linear model with an additional tree part  on the same scale.
    A four-step procedure is proposed to fit the model and test  the joint effect of
    the selected tree part while adjusting on confounding factors.  We also proposed
    an ensemble procedure based on the bagging to improve prediction  accuracy and computed
    several scores of importance for variable selection.
