  summary: We provide functions to perform taxometric analyses. This package contains 46 functions,
    but only 5 should be called directly by users. CheckData() should be run prior to
    any taxometric analysis to ensure that the data are appropriate for taxometric analysis.
    RunTaxometrics() performs taxometric analyses for a sample of data. RunCCFIProfile()
    performs a series of taxometric analyses to generate a CCFI profile. CreateData()
    generates a sample of categorical or dimensional data. ClassifyCases() assigns cases
    to groups using the base-rate classification method.
