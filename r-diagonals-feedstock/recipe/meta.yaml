  summary: Several tools for handling block-matrix diagonals and similar constructs are implemented.
    Block-diagonal matrices can be extracted or removed using two small functions implemented
    here. In addition, non-square matrices are supported. Block diagonal matrices occur
    when two dimensions of a data set are combined along one edge of a matrix. For example,
    trade-flow data in the 'decompr' and 'gvc' packages have each country-industry combination
    occur along both edges of the matrix.
