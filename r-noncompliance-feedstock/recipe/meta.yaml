  summary: A finite-population significance test of the 'sharp' causal null hypothesis that treatment
    exposure X has no effect on final outcome Y, within the principal stratum of Compliers.
    A generalized likelihood ratio test statistic is used, and the resulting p-value
    is exact. Currently, it is assumed that there are only Compliers and Never Takers
    in the population.
