  summary: R-level and C++-level functionality to generate random deviates from and calculate
    moments of a Truncated Normal distribution using the algorithm of Robert (1995)
    <DOI:10.1007/BF00143942>. In addition to RNG, functions for calculating moments,
    densities, and entropies are provided at both levels.
