  summary: 'Calculates a Satorra-Bentler scaled chi-squared difference test between nested models
    that were estimated using maximum likelihood (ML) with robust standard errors, which
    cannot be calculated the traditional way. For details see Satorra & Bentler (2001)
    <doi:10.1007/bf02296192> and Satorra & Bentler (2010) <doi:10.1007/s11336-009-9135-y>.
    This package may be particularly helpful when used in conjunction with ''Mplus''
    software, specifically when implementing the complex survey option. In such cases,
    the model estimator in ''Mplus'' defaults to ML with robust standard errors.    '
