  summary: The fitting algorithms considered in this package have two major objectives. One is
    to provide a smoothing device to fit distributions to data using the weight and
    unweighted discretised approach based on the bin width of the histogram. The other
    is to provide a definitive fit to the data set using the maximum likelihood and
    quantile matching estimation. Other methods such as moment matching, starship method,
    L moment matching are also provided. Diagnostics on goodness of fit can be done
    via qqplots, KS-resample tests and comparing mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis
    of the data with the fitted distribution.
