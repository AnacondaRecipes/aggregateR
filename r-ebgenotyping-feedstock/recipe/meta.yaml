  summary: Genotyping the population using next generation sequencing data is essentially important
    for the rare variant detection. In order to distinguish the genomic structural variation
    from sequencing error, we propose a statistical model which involves the genotype
    effect through a latent variable to depict the distribution of non-reference allele
    frequency data among different samples and different genome loci, while decomposing
    the sequencing error into sample effect and positional effect. An ECM algorithm
    is implemented to estimate the model parameters, and then the genotypes and SNPs
    are inferred based on the empirical Bayes method.
