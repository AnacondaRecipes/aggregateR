  summary: When taking online surveys, participants sometimes respond to items without regard
    to their content. These types of responses, referred to as careless or insufficient
    effort responding, constitute significant problems for data quality, leading to
    distortions in data analysis and hypothesis testing, such as spurious correlations.
    The 'R' package 'careless' provides solutions designed to detect such careless /
    insufficient effort responses by allowing easy calculation of indices proposed in
    the literature. It currently supports the calculation of longstring, even-odd consistency,
    psychometric synonyms/antonyms, Mahalanobis distance, and intra-individual response
    variability (also termed inter-item standard deviation). For a review of these methods,
    see Curran (2016) <doi:10.1016/j.jesp.2015.07.006>.
