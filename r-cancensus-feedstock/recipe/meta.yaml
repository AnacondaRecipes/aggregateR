  summary: Integrated, convenient, and uniform access to Canadian Census data and geography retrieved
    using the 'CensusMapper' API. This package produces analysis-ready tidy data frames
    and spatial data in multiple formats, as well as convenience functions for working
    with Census variables, variable hierarchies, and region selection. API keys are
