  summary: Table 1 is the classical way to describe the patients in a clinical study. The amount
    of splits in the data in such a table is limited. Table1Heatmap draws a heatmap
    of all crosstables that can be generated with the data. Users can choose between
    showing the actual crosstables or direction of effect of associations, and highlight
    associations by number of patients or p-values.
