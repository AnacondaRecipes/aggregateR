  summary: Some elementary matrix algebra tools are implemented to manage block matrices or partitioned
    matrix, i.e. "matrix of matrices" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_matrix). The
    block matrix is here defined as a new S3 object. In this package, some methods for
    "matrix" object are rewritten for "blockmatrix" object. New methods are implemented.
    This package was created to solve equation systems with block matrices for the analysis
    of environmental vector time series . Bugs/comments/questions/collaboration of any
    kind are warmly welcomed.
