  summary: Identification of sets of objects with shared features is a common operation in all
    disciplines. Analysis of intersections among multiple sets is fundamental for in-depth
    understanding of their complex relationships. This package implements a theoretical
    framework for efficient computation of statistical distributions of multi-set intersections
    based upon combinatorial theory, and provides multiple scalable techniques for visualizing
    the intersection statistics. The statistical algorithm behind this package was published
    in Wang et al. (2015) <doi:10.1038/srep16923>.
