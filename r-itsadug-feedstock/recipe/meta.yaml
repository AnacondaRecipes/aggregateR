  summary: GAMM (Generalized Additive Mixed Modeling; Lin & Zhang, 1999) as implemented in the
    R package 'mgcv' (Wood, S.N., 2006; 2011) is a nonlinear regression analysis which
    is particularly useful for time course data such as EEG, pupil dilation, gaze data
    (eye tracking), and articulography recordings, but also for behavioral data such
    as reaction times and response data. As time course measures are sensitive to autocorrelation
    problems, GAMMs implements methods to reduce the autocorrelation problems. This
    package includes functions for the evaluation of GAMM models (e.g., model comparisons,
    determining regions of significance, inspection of autocorrelational structure in
    residuals) and interpreting of GAMMs (e.g., visualization of complex interactions,
    and contrasts).
