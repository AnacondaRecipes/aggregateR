  summary: Load and analyze updated time series worldwide data of reported cases for the Novel
    Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) from different sources, including the Johns Hopkins
    University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) data repository
    <https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19>, "Our World in Data" <https://github.com/owid/>
    among several others. The datasets reporting the COVID-19 cases are available in
    two main modalities, as a time series sequences and aggregated data for the last
    day with greater spatial resolution. Several analysis, visualization and modelling
    functions are available in the package that will allow the user to compute and visualize
    total number of cases, total number of changes and growth rate globally or for an
    specific geographical location, while at the same time generating models using these
    trends; generate interactive visualizations and generate Susceptible-Infected-Recovered
    (SIR) model for the disease spread.
