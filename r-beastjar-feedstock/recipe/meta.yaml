  summary: Provides JAR to perform Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference using the popular
    Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees 'BEAST' software library of Suchard
    et al (2018) <doi:10.1093/ve/vey016>. 'BEAST' supports auto-tuning Metropolis-Hastings,
    slice, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Sequential Monte Carlo sampling for a large variety
    of composable standard and phylogenetic statistical models using high performance
    computing.  By placing the 'BEAST' JAR in this package, we offer an efficient distribution
    system for 'BEAST' use by other R packages using CRAN.
