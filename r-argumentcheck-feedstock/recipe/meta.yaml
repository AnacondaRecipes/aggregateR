  summary: The typical process of checking arguments in functions is iterative.  In this process,
    an error may be returned and the user may fix it only to receive another error on
    a different argument.  'ArgumentCheck' facilitates a more helpful way to perform
    argument checks allowing the programmer to run all of the checks and then return
    all of the errors and warnings in a single message.
