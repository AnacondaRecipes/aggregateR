  summary: The estimation of static and dynamic connectedness measures is created in a modular
    and user-friendly way. Besides, the time domain connectedness approaches, this package
    further allows to estimate the frequency connectedness approach, the joint spillover
    index and the extended joint connectedness approach. In addition, all connectedness
    frameworks can be based upon orthogonalized and generalized VAR, QVAR, LASSO VAR,
    Ridge VAR, Elastic Net VAR and TVP-VAR models. Furthermore, the package includes
    the conditional, decomposed and partial connectedness measures as well as the pairwise
    connectedness index, influence index and corrected total connectedness index. Finally,
    a battery of datasets are available allowing to replicate a variety of connectedness
    papers.
