  summary: 'The composites are linear combinations of their indicators in composite based structural
    equation models. Structural models are considered consisting of two blocks. The
    indicators of the exogenous composites are named by X, the indicators of the endogenous
    by Y. Reflective relations are given by arrows pointing  from the composite to their
    indicators. Their values are called loadings.  In a reflective-reflective scenario
    all indicators have loadings. Arrows are pointing to their indicators only from
    the endogenous composites in  the formative-reflective scenario. There are no loadings
    at all in the formative-formative scenario. The covariance matrices are computed
    for these three scenarios. They can be used to simulate these models. These models
    can also be estimated and a segmentation procedure is included as well.   '
