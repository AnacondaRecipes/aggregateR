  summary: Provides a backward-pipe operator for 'magrittr' (%<%) or 'pipeR' (%<<%) that allows
    for a performing operations from right-to-left. This allows writing more legible
    code where right-to-left ordering is natural. This is common with hierarchies and
    nested structures such as trees, directories or markup languages (e.g. HTML and
    XML). The package also includes a R-Studio add-in that can be bound to a keyboard
    shortcut.
