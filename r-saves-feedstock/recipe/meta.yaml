  summary: The purpose of this package is to be able to save and load only the needed variables/columns
    of a dataframe in special binary files (tar archives) - which seems to be a lot
    faster method than loading the whole binary object (RData files) via load() function,
    or than loading columns from SQLite/MySQL databases via SQL commands (see vignettes).
    Performance gain on SSD drives is a lot more sensible compared to basic load() function.
    The performance improvement gained by loading only the chosen variables in binary
    format can be useful in some special cases (e.g. where merging data tables is not
    an option and very different datasets are needed for reporting), but be sure if
    using this package that you really need this, as non-standard file formats are used!
