  summary: 'An implementation of the induced smoothing (IS) idea to lasso regularization models
    to allow estimation and inference on the model coefficients (currently hypothesis
    testing only). Linear, logistic, Poisson and gamma regressions with several link
    functions are implemented. The algorithm is described in the original paper: Cilluffo,
