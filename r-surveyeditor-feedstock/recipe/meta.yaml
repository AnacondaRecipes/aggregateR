  summary: 'Help generate slides for surveys or experiments. The resulted slides allow the subject
    to respond with the use of the mouse (usual keyboard input is  replaced with clicking
    on a virtual keyboard on the slide). Subjects'' responses are saved to the user-
    specified location in the form of R-readable text file. To allow flexibility, each
    function in  this package generates a particular type of slides thus general R function
    writing skills are  required to compile these edited slides. '
