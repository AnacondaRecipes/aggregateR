  summary: Implements Firth's penalized maximum likelihood bias reduction method  for Cox regression
    which has been shown to provide a solution in case of monotone likelihood (nonconvergence
    of likelihood function). The program fits profile penalized likelihood confidence
    intervals which were proved to outperform Wald confidence intervals.
