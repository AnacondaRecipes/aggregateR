  summary: Implements Firth's penalized maximum likelihood bias reduction method  for Cox regression
    which has been shown to provide a solution in case of monotone likelihood (nonconvergence
    of likelihood function), see Heinze and Schemper (2001) and Heinze and Dunkler (2008).
    The program fits profile penalized likelihood confidence intervals which were proved
    to outperform Wald confidence intervals.
