  summary: Analysis of large datasets of fixed coupon bonds, allowing for irregular first and
    last coupon periods and various day count conventions. With this package you can
    compute the yield to maturity, the modified and MacAulay durations and the convexity
    of fixed-rate bonds. It provides the function AnnivDates, which can be used to evaluate
    the quality of the data and return time-invariant properties and temporal structure
    of a bond.
