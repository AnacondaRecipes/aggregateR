  summary: Package implements Kernel-based Regularized Least Squares (KRLS), a machine learning
    method to fit multidimensional functions y=f(x) for regression and classification
    problems without relying on linearity or additivity assumptions. KRLS finds the
    best fitting function by minimizing the squared loss of a Tikhonov regularization
    problem, using Gaussian kernels as radial basis functions. For further details see
    Hainmueller and Hazlett (2014).
