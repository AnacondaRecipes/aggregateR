  summary: 'Package performs Cox regression and survival distribution function estimation when
    the survival times are subject to double truncation. In case that the survival and
    truncation times are quasi-independent, the estimation procedure for each method
    involves inverse probability weighting, where the weights correspond to the inverse
    of the selection probabilities and are estimated using the survival times and truncation
    times only. A test for checking this independence assumption is also included in
    this package. The functions available in this package for Cox regression, survival
    distribution function estimation, and testing independence under double truncation
    are based on the following methods, respectively: Rennert and Xie (2018) <doi:10.1111/biom.12809>,
    Shen (2010) <doi:10.1007/s10463-008-0192-2>, Martin and Betensky (2005) <doi:10.1198/016214504000001538>.
    When the survival times are dependent on at least one of the truncation times, an
    EM algorithm is employed to obtain point estimates for the regression coefficients.
    The standard errors are calculated using the bootstrap method. See Rennert and Xie
    (2022) <doi:10.1111/biom.13451>. Both the independent and dependent cases assume
    no censoring is present in the data. Please contact Lior Rennert <liorr@clemson.edu>
