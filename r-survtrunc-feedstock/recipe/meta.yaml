  summary: 'Package performs Cox regression and survival distribution function estimation when
    the survival times are subject to double truncation. The estimation procedure for
    each method involves inverse probability weighting, where the weights correspond
    to the inverse of the selection probabilities and are estimated using the survival
    times and truncation times only. Both methods require that the survival and truncation
    times are quasi-independent. A test for checking this independence assumption is
    also included in this package. The functions available in this package for Cox regression,
    survival distribution function estimation, and testing independence under double
    truncation are based on the following methods, respectively: Rennert and Xie (2017)
    <doi:10.1111/biom.12809>, Shen (2010) <doi:10.1007/s10463-008-0192-2>, Martin and
