  summary: 'Statistical classification and regression have been popular among various fields
    and stayed in the limelight of scientists of those fields. Examples of the fields
    include clinical trials where the statistical classification of patients is indispensable
    to predict the clinical courses of diseases. Considering the negative impact of
    diseases on performing daily tasks, correctly classifying patients based on the
    clinical information is vital in that we need to identify patients of the high-risk
    group to develop a severe state and arrange medical treatment for them at an opportune
    moment. Deep learning - a part of artificial intelligence - has gained much attention,
    and research on it burgeons during past decades: see, e.g, Kazemi and Mirroshandel
    (2018) <DOI:10.1016/j.artmed.2017.12.001>. It is a veritable technique which was
    originally designed for the classification, and hence, the Buddle package can provide
    sublime solutions to various challenging classification and regression problems
    encountered in the clinical trials. The Buddle package is based on the back-propagation
    algorithm - together with various powerful techniques such as batch normalization
    and dropout - which performs a multi-layer feed-forward neural network: see Krizhevsky
    et. al (2017) <DOI:10.1145/3065386>, Schmidhuber (2015) <DOI:10.1016/j.neunet.2014.09.003>
    and LeCun et al. (1998) <DOI:10.1109/5.726791> for more details. This package contains
    two main functions: TrainBuddle() and FetchBuddle(). TrainBuddle() builds a feed-forward
    neural network model and trains the model. FetchBuddle() recalls the trained model
    which is the output of TrainBuddle(), classifies or regresses given data, and make
    a final prediction for the data.'
