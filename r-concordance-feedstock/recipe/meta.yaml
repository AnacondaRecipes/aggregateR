  summary: A set of utilities for matching products in different classification codes used in
    international trade research. It supports concordance between the Harmonized System
    (HS0, HS1, HS2, HS3, HS4, HS5, HS combined), the Standard International Trade Classification
    (SITC1, SITC2, SITC3, SITC4), the North American Industry Classification System
    (NAICS combined), as well as the Broad Economic Categories (BEC), the International
    Standard of Industrial Classification (ISIC), and the Standard Industrial Classification
    (SIC). It also provides code nomenclature/descriptions look-up, Rauch classification
    look-up (via concordance to SITC2), and trade elasticity look-up (via concordance
    to HS0 or SITC3 codes).
