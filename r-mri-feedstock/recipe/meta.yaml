  summary: It provides functions to compute the values of different modifications of the Rand
    and Wallace indices. The indices are used to measure the stability or similarity
    of two partitions obtained on two different sets of units with a non-empty intercept.
    Splitting and merging of clusters can (depends on the selected index) have a different
    effect on the value of the indices.  The indices are proposed in Cugmas and Ferligoj
    (2018) <http://ibmi.mf.uni-lj.si/mz/2018/no-1/Cugmas2018.pdf>.
