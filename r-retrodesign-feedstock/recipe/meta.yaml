  summary: Provides tools for working with Type S (Sign) and Type M (Magnitude) errors, as proposed
    in Gelman and Tuerlinckx (2000) <doi.org/10.1007/s001800000040> and Gelman & Carlin
    (2014) <doi.org/10.1177/1745691614551642>. In addition to simply calculating the
    probability of Type S/M error, the package includes functions for calculating these
    errors across a variety of effect sizes for comparison, and recommended sample size
    given "tolerances" for Type S/M errors. To improve the speed of these calculations,
    closed forms solutions for the probability of a Type S/M error from Lu, Qiu, and
    Deng (2018) <doi.org/10.1111/bmsp.12132> are implemented. As of 1.0.0, this includes
    support only for simple research designs. See the package vignette for a fuller
    exposition on how Type S/M errors arise in research, and how to analyze them using
    the type of design analysis proposed in the above papers.
