  summary: 'Tooling to group dates by a variety of periods including: yearly, monthly, by second,
    by week of the month, and more.  The groups are defined in such a way that they
    also represent the distance between dates in terms of the period. This extracts
    valuable information that can be used in further calculations that rely on a specific
    temporal spacing between observations.'
