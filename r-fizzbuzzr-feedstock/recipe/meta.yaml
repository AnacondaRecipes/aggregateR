  summary: An implementation of the Fizz Buzz algorithm, as defined e.g. in <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz>.  It
    provides the standard algorithm with 3 replaced by Fizz and 5 replaced by Buzz,
    with the option of specifying start  and end numbers, step size and the numbers
    being replaced by fizz and buzz, respectively. This package gives  interviewers
    the optional answer of "I use fizzbuzzR::fizzbuzz()" when interviewing rather than
    having to write an algorithm themselves.
