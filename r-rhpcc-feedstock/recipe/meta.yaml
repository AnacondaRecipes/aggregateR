  summary: rHpcc is an R package providing an Interface between R and HPCC.Familiarity with ECL
    (Enterprise Control Language) is a must to use this package.HPCC is a massive parallel-processing
    computing platform that solves Big Data problems.ECL is the Enterprise Control Language
    designed specifically for huge data projects using the HPCC platform.Its extreme
    scalability comes from a design that allows you to leverage every query you create
    for re-use in subsequent queries as needed. To do this, ECL takes a dictionary approach
    to building queries wherein each ECL definition defines an Attribute. Each previously
    defined Attribute can then be used in succeeding ECL Attribute definitions as the
    language extends itself as you use it.
