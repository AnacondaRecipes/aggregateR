  summary: Functions are provided to calculate and display ridge TRACE Diagnostics for a variety
    of alternative Shrinkage Paths. While all methods focus on Maximum Likelihood estimation
    of unknown true effects under normal distribution-theory, some estimates are modified
    to be Unbiased or to have "Correct Range" when estimating either [1] the noncentrality
    of the F-ratio for testing that true Beta coefficients are Zeros or [2] the "relative"
    MSE Risk (i.e. MSE divided by true sigma-square, where the "relative" variance of
    OLS is known.) The eff.ridge() function implements the "Efficient Shrinkage Path"
    introduced in Obenchain (2022) <Open Statistics>. This "p-Parameter" Shrinkage-Path
    always passes through the vector of regression coefficient estimates Most-Likely
    to achieve the overall Optimal Variance-Bias Trade-Off and is the shortest Path
    with this property. Functions eff.aug() and eff.biv() augment the calculations made
    by eff.ridge() to provide plots of the bivariate confidence ellipses corresponding
    to any of the p*(p-1) possible ordered pairs of shrunken regression coefficients.
    Functions for plotting TRACE Diagnostics now have more options.
