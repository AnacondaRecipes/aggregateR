  summary: Identify and display TRACEs for a specified shrinkage path and determine the extent
    of shrinkage most likely, under normal distribution theory, to produce an optimal
    reduction in MSE Risk in estimates of regression (beta) coefficients. Alternative
    estimates are also provided when ill-conditioned (nearly multicollinear) models
    yield OLS estimates with "wrong" numerical signs.
