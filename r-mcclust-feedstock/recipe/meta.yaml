  summary: Implements methods for processing a sample of (hard) clusterings, e.g. the MCMC output
    of a Bayesian clustering model. Among them are methods that find a single best clustering
    to represent the sample, which are based on the posterior similarity matrix or a
    relabelling algorithm.
