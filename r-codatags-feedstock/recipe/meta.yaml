  summary: Computes genomic breeding values using external information on the markers. The package
    fits a linear mixed model with heteroscedastic random effects, where the random
    effect variance is fitted using a linear predictor and a log link. The method is
    described in Mouresan, Selle and Ronnegard (2019) <doi:10.1101/636746>.
