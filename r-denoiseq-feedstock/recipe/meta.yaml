  summary: Given count data from two conditions, it determines which transcripts are differentially
    expressed across the two conditions using Bayesian inference of the parameters of  a
    bottom-up model for PCR amplification. This model is  developed in Ndifon Wilfred,
    Hilah Gal, Eric Shifrut, Rina Aharoni, Nissan Yissachar, Nir Waysbort, Shlomit Reich
    Zeliger, Ruth Arnon, and Nir Friedman (2012), <http://www.pnas.org/content/109/39/15865.full>,
    and results in a distribution for the counts that is a superposition of the binomial
    and negative binomial distribution.
