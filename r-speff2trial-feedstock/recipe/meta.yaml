  summary: Performs estimation and testing of the treatment effect in a 2-group randomized clinical
    trial with a quantitative, dichotomous, or right-censored time-to-event endpoint.
    The method improves efficiency by leveraging baseline predictors of the endpoint.
    The inverse probability weighting technique of Robins, Rotnitzky, and Zhao (JASA,
    1994) is used to provide unbiased estimation when the endpoint is missing at random.
