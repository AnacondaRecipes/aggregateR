  summary: A collection of functions helpful in learning the basic tenets of Bayesian statistical
    inference.  It contains functions for summarizing basic one and two parameter posterior
    distributions and predictive distributions.  It contains MCMC algorithms for summarizing
    posterior distributions defined by the user.  It also contains functions for regression
    models, hierarchical models, Bayesian tests, and illustrations of Gibbs sampling.
