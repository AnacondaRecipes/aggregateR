  summary: 'A quadratic time dynamic programming algorithm can be used to compute an approximate
    solution to the problem of finding the most likely changepoints with respect to
    the Poisson likelihood, subject to a constraint on the number of segments, and the
    changes which must alternate: up, down, up, down, etc. For more info read <http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/hocking15.html>
