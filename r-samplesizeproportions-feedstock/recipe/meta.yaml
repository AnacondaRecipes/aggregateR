  summary: "Sample size requirements calculation using three different Bayesian criteria in the
    context of designing an experiment to estimate the difference between two binomial
    proportions. Functions for calculation of required sample sizes for the Average
    Length Criterion, the Average Coverage Criterion and the Worst Outcome Criterion
    in the context of binomial observations are provided. In all cases, estimation of
    the difference between two binomial proportions is considered. Functions for both
    the fully Bayesian and the mixed Bayesian/likelihood approaches are provided. For
