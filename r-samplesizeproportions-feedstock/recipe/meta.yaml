  summary: A set of R functions for calculating sample size requirements using three different
    Bayesian criteria in the context of designing an experiment to estimate the difference
    between two binomial proportions. Functions for calculation of required sample sizes
    for the Average Length Criterion, the Average Coverage Criterion and the Worst Outcome
    Criterion in the context of binomial observations are provided. In all cases, estimation
    of the difference between two binomial proportions is considered. Functions for
    both the fully Bayesian and the mixed Bayesian/likelihood approaches are provided.
