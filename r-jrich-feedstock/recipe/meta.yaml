  summary: 'These functions calculate the taxonomic measures presented in Miranda-Esquivel (2016).  The
    package introduces Jack-knife resampling in evolutionary distinctiveness prioritization
    analysis,  as a way to evaluate the support of the ranking in area prioritization,
    and the persistence of a given area  in a conservation analysis. The algorithm is
    described in: Miranda-Esquivel, D (2016) <DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-22461-9_11>.'
