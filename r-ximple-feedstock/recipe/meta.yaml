  summary: Provides a simple XML tree parser/generator. It includes functions to read XML files
    into R objects, get information out of and into nodes, and write R objects back
    to XML code. It's not as powerful as the 'XML' package and doesn't aim to be, but
    for simple XML handling it could be useful. It was originally developed for the
    R GUI and IDE 'RKWard' <https://rkward.kde.org>, to make plugin development easier.
