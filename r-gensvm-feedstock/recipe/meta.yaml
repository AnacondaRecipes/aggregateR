  summary: 'The GenSVM classifier is a generalized multiclass support vector machine (SVM). This
    classifier aims to find decision boundaries that separate the classes with as wide
    a margin as possible. In GenSVM, the loss function is very flexible in the way that
    misclassifications are penalized.  This allows the user to tune the classifier to
    the dataset at hand and potentially obtain higher classification accuracy than alternative
    multiclass SVMs.  Moreover, this flexibility means that GenSVM has a number of other
    multiclass SVMs as special cases. One of the other advantages of GenSVM is that
    it is trained in the primal space, allowing the use of warm starts during optimization.  This
    means that for common tasks such as cross validation or repeated model fitting,
    GenSVM can be trained very quickly. Based on: G.J.J. van den Burg and P.J.F. Groenen
