  summary: This is a package for estimating the population size of migratory caribou herds based
    on large scale aggregations monitored by radio telemetry. It implements the methodology
    found in the article by Rivest et al. (1998) about caribou abundance estimation.
    It also includes a function based on the Lincoln-Petersen Index as applied to radio
    telemetry data by White and Garrott (1990).
