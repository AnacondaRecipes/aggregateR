  summary: Estimation of population size of migratory caribou herds based on large scale aggregations
    monitored by radio telemetry. It implements the methodology found in the article
    by Rivest et al. (1998) about caribou abundance estimation. It also includes a function
    based on the Lincoln-Petersen Index as applied to radio telemetry data by White
    and Garrott (1990).
