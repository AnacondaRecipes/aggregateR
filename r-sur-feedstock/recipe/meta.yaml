  summary: 'Access to the datasets and many of the functions used in "Statistics Using R: An
    Integrative Approach". These datasets include a subset of the National Education
    Longitudinal Study, the Framingham Heart Study, as well as several simulated datasets
    used in the examples throughout the textbook. The functions included in the package
    reproduce some of the functionality of ''Stata'' that is not directly available
    in ''R''.  The package also contains a tutorial on basic data frame management,
    including how to handle missing data.'
