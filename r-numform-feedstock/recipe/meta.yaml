  summary: Format numbers and plots for publication; includes the removal of leading zeros, standardization
    of number of digits, addition of affixes, and a p-value formatter. These tools combine
    the functionality of several 'base' functions such as 'paste()', 'format()', and
    'sprintf()' into specific use case functions that are named in a way that is consistent
    with usage, making their names easy to remember and easy to deploy.
