  summary: An alternative to carrying out phenotypic adaptability and stability analyses, taking
    into account nonparametric statistics. Can be used as a robust approach, less sensitive
    to departures from common genotypic, environmental, and GxE effects data assumptions
    (e.g., normal distribution of errors).
