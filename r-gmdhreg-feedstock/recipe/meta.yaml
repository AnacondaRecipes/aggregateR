  summary: 'Regression using GMDH algorithms from Prof. Alexey G. Ivakhnenko. Group Method of
    Data Handling (GMDH), or polynomial neural networks, is a family of inductive algorithms
    that performs gradually complicated polynomial models and selecting the best solution
    by an external criterion. In other words, inductive GMDH algorithms give possibility
    finding automatically interrelations in data, and selecting an optimal structure
    of model or network. The package includes GMDH Combinatorial, GMDH MIA (Multilayered
    Iterative Algorithm), GMDH GIA (Generalized Iterative Algorithm) and GMDH Combinatorial
    with Active Neurons. An introduction of GMDH algorithms: Farlow, S.J. (1981): "The
