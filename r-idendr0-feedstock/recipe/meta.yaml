  summary: Interactive dendrogram that enables the user to select and color clusters, to zoom
    and pan the dendrogram, and to visualize the clustered data not only in a built-in
    heat map, but also in 'GGobi' interactive plots and user-supplied plots.  This is
    a backport of Qt-based 'idendro'  (<https://github.com/tsieger/idendro>) to base
    R graphics and  Tcl/Tk GUI.
