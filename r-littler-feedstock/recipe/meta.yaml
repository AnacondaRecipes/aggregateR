  summary: A scripting and command-line front-end is provided by 'r' (aka 'littler') as a lightweight
    binary wrapper around the GNU R language and environment for statistical computing
    and graphics. While R can be used in batch mode, the r binary adds full support
    for both 'shebang'-style scripting (i.e. using a  hash-mark-exclamation-path expression
    as the first line in scripts) as well as command-line use in standard Unix pipelines.
    In other words, r provides the R language without the environment.
