  summary: Enables transformation of Verbal Autopsy data collected with the WHO 2016 questionnaire
    (versions 1.4.1 & 1.5.1) or the WHO 2014 questionnaire for automated coding of Cause
    of Death using the InSilicoVA (data.type = "WHO2016") and InterVA5 algorithms. Previous
    versions of this package supported user-supplied mappings (via the map_records function),
    but this functionality has been removed.  This package is made available by WHO
    and the Bloomberg Data for Health Initiative.
