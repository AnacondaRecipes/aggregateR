  summary: Examine any number of time series data frames to identify instances in which various
    criteria are met within specified time frames. In clinical medicine, these types
    of events are often called "constellations of signs and symptoms", because a single
    condition depends on a series of events occurring within a certain amount of time
    of each other. This package was written to work with any number of time series data
    frames and is optimized for speed to work well with data frames with millions of
    rows.
