  summary: Methods for choosing the rank of an SVD (singular value decomposition) approximation
    via cross validation. The package provides both Gabriel-style "block" holdouts and
    Wold-style "speckled" holdouts. It also includes an implementation of the SVDImpute
    algorithm. For more information about Bi-cross-validation, see Owen & Perry's 2009
    AoAS article (at <arXiv:0908.2062>) and Perry's 2009 PhD thesis (at <arXiv:0909.3052>).
