  summary: ' Methods for choosing the rank of an SVD approximation via cross validation.  The
    package provides both Gabriel-style "block" holdouts and Wold-style "speckled" holdouts.  It
    also includes an  implementation of the SVDImpute algorithm.  For more information
    about Bi-cross-validation, see Owen & Perry''s 2009 AoAS article (at http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2062)
    and Perry''s 2009 PhD thesis (at http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.3052).'
