  summary: Equivalence tests and related confidence intervals for the comparison of two treatments,
    simultaneously for one or many normally distributed, primary response variables
    (endpoints). The step-up procedure of Quan et al. (2001) is both applied for differences
    and extended to ratios of means. A related single-step procedure is also available.
