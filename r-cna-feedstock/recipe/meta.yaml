  summary: Provides comprehensive functionalities for causal modeling with Coincidence Analysis
    (CNA), which is a configurational comparative method of causal data analysis that
    was first introduced in Baumgartner (2009) <doi:10.1177/0049124109339369>, and generalized
    in Baumgartner & Ambuehl (2018) <doi:10.1017/psrm.2018.45>. CNA is related to Qualitative
    Comparative Analysis (QCA), but contrary to the latter, it is custom-built for uncovering
    causal structures with multiple outcomes and it builds causal models from the bottom
    up by gradually combining single factors to complex dependency structures until
    the requested thresholds of model fit are met. The new functionalities provided
    by this package version include functions for evaluating and benchmarking the correctness
    of CNA's output, a function determining whether a solution is an INUS model, a function
    bringing non-INUS expressions into INUS form, and a function for identifying cyclic
    models. The package vignette has been updated accordingly.
