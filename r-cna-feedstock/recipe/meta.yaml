  summary: Provides comprehensive functionalities for causal modeling with Coincidence Analysis
    (CNA), which is a configurational comparative method of causal data analysis that
    was first introduced in Baumgartner (2009) <doi:10.1177/0049124109339369>, and generalized
    in Baumgartner & Ambuehl (2018) <doi:10.1017/psrm.2018.45>. CNA is designed to recover
    INUS-causation from data, which is particularly relevant for analyzing processes
    featuring conjunctural causation (component causation) and equifinality (alternative
    causation). CNA is currently the only method for INUS-discovery that allows for
    multiple effects (outcomes/endogenous factors), meaning it can analyze common-cause
    and causal chain structures.
