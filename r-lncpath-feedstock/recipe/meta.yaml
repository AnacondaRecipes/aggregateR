  summary: Identifies pathways synergisticly regulated by the interested lncRNA(long non-coding
    RNA) sets based on a lncRNA-mRNA(messenger RNA) interaction network. 1) The lncRNA-mRNA
    interaction network was built from the protein-protein interactions and the lncRNA-mRNA
    co-expression relationships in 28 RNA-Seq data sets. 2) The interested lncRNAs can
    be mapped into networks as seed nodes and a random walk strategy will be performed
    to evaluate the rate of each coding genes influenced by the seed lncRNAs. 3) Pathways
    regulated by the lncRNA set will be evaluated by a weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic
    as an ES Score. 4) The p value and false discovery rate value will also be calculated
    through a permutation analysis. 5) The running score of each pathway can be plotted
    and the heat map of each pathway can also be plotted if an expression profile is
    provided. 6) The rank and scores of the gene list of each pathway can be printed.
