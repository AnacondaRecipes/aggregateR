  summary: A collection of functions for conducting meta-analysis using a structural equation
    modeling (SEM) approach via the 'OpenMx' and 'lavaan' packages. It also implements
    various procedures to perform meta-analytic structural equation modeling on the
    correlation and covariance matrices, see Cheung (2015) <doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01521>.
