  summary: Provides functions for estimating power or sample size for RNA-Seq studies. Empirical
    approach is used and the data is assumed to be count in nature. The underlying distribution
    of data is assumed to be Poisson or negative binomial. The package contains 6 function;
    4 functions provide estimates of sample size or power for Poisson and Negative Binomial
    distribution; 2 functions provide plots of power for given sample size or sample
    size for given power.
