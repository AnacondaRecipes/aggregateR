  summary: For making Trellis-type conditioning plots without strip labels. This is useful for
    displaying the structure of results from factorial designs and other studies when
    many conditioning variables would clutter the display with layers of redundant strip
    labels. Settings of the variables are encoded by layout and spacing in the trellis
    array and decoded by a separate legend. The functionality is implemented by a single
    S3 generic strucplot() function that is a wrapper for the Lattice package's xyplot()
    function. This allows access to all Lattice graphics capabilities in the usual way.
