  summary: Calculates spatial pattern analysis using a T-square sample procedure. This method
    is based on two measures "x" and "y". "x" - Distance from the random point to the
    nearest individual. "y" - Distance from individual to its nearest neighbor. This
    is a methodology commonly used in phytosociology or marine benthos ecology to analyze
    the species' distribution (random, uniform or clumped patterns). Ludwig & Reynolds
    (1988, ISBN:0471832359).
