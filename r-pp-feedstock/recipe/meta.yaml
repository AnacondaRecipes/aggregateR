  summary: The PP package includes estimation of (MLE, WLE, MAP, EAP, ROBUST) person parameters
    for the 1,2,3,4-PL model and the GPCM (generalized partial credit model). The parameters
    are estimated under the assumption that the item parameters are known and fixed.
    The package is useful e.g. in the case that items from an item pool / item bank
    with known item parameters are administered to a new population of test-takers and
    an ability estimation for every test-taker is needed.
