  summary: A package for building hierarchical block matrices from association matrices and for
    performing multi-scale analysis. It specifically targets chromatin contact maps,
    generated from high-throughput chromosome conformation capture data, such as 5C
    and Hi-C, and provides methods for detecting movements and for computing chain hierarchy
    and region communicability across scales.
