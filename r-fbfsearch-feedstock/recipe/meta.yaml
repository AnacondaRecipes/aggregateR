  summary: 'We propose an objective Bayesian algorithm for searching the space of Gaussian directed
    acyclic graph (DAG) models. The algorithm proposed makes use of moment fractional
    Bayes factors (MFBF) and thus it is suitable for learning sparse graph. The algorithm
    is implemented by using Armadillo: an open-source C++ linear algebra library.'
