  summary: This package contains functions that allow to build classification trees for ordinal
    responses within the CART framework. The trees are grown using the Generalized Gini
    impurity function, where the misclassification costs are given by the absolute or
    squared differences in scores assigned to the categories of the response. Pruning
    is based on the total misclassification rate or on the total misclassification cost.
