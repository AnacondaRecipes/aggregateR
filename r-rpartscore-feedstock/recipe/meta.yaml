  summary: Recursive partitioning methods to build classification trees for ordinal responses
    within the CART framework. Trees are grown using the Generalized Gini impurity function,
    where the misclassification costs are given by the absolute or squared differences
    in scores assigned to the categories of the response. Pruning is based on the total
    misclassification rate or on the total misclassification cost.
