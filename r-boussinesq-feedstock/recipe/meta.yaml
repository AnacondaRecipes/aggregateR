  summary: A collection of R functions were implemented from published and available analytic
    solutions for the One-Dimensional Boussinesq Equation (ground-water). In particular,
    the function "beq.lin()" is the analytic solution of the linearized form of Boussinesq
    Equation between two different head-based boundary (Dirichlet) conditions; "beq.song"
    is the non-linear power-series analytic solution of the motion of a wetting front
    over a dry bedrock (Song at al, 2007, see complete reference on function documentation).
    Bugs/comments/questions/collaboration of any kind are warmly welcomed.
