  summary: This package is a collection of R functions implemented from published and available
    analytic solutions for the One-Dimensional Boussinesq Equation (ground-water). In
    particular, the function "beq.lin" is the analytic solution of the linearized form
    of Boussinesq Equation between two different head-based boundary (Dirichlet) conditions;
    "beq.song" is the non-linear power-series analytic solution of the motion of a wetting
    front over a dry bedrock (Song at al, 2007, see complete reference on function documentation).
    Bugs/comments/questions/collaboration of any kind are warmly welcomed.
