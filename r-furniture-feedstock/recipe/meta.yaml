  summary: 'Contains four main functions (i.e., four pieces of furniture): table1() which produces
    a well-formatted table of descriptive statistics common as Table 1 in research articles,
    tableC() which produces a well-formatted table of correlations, tableF() which provides
    frequency counts, and washer() which is helpful in cleaning up the data. These furniture-themed
    functions are designed to simplify common tasks in quantitative analysis. Other
    data summary and cleaning tools are also available.'
