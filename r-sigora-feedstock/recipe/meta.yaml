  summary: ' Pathway Analysis is the process of statistically linking observations on  the molecular
    level to biological processes or pathways on the systems(i.e.  organism, organ,
    tissue, cell) level.   Traditionally, pathway analysis methods regard pathways as
    collections of  single genes and treat all genes in a pathway as equally informative.
    This  can lead to identification of spurious pathways as statistically significant,
    since components are often shared amongst pathways.  SIGORA seeks to avoid this
    pitfall by focusing on genes or gene-pairs  that are (as a combination) specific
    to a single pathway.  In relying on  such pathway gene-pair signatures (Pathway-GPS),
    SIGORA inherently uses  the status of other genes in the experimental context to
    identify the most  relevant pathways.  The current version allows for pathway analysis
    of human and mouse datasets  and contains pre-computed Pathway-GPS data for pathways
    in the KEGG and  Reactome pathway repositories as well as mechanisms for extracting
    GPS for  user supplied repositories.'
