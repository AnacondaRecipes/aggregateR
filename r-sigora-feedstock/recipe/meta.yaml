  summary: Pathway Analysis is statistically linking observations on the molecular level to biological
    processes or pathways on the systems(i.e., organism, organ, tissue, cell) level.
    Traditionally, pathway analysis methods regard pathways as collections of single
    genes and treat all genes in a pathway as equally informative. However, this can
    lead to identifying spurious pathways as statistically significant since components
    are often shared amongst pathways. SIGORA seeks to avoid this pitfall by focusing
    on genes or gene pairs that are (as a combination) specific to a single pathway.
    In relying on such pathway gene-pair signatures (Pathway-GPS), SIGORA inherently
    uses the status of other genes in the experimental context to identify the most
    relevant pathways. The current version allows for pathway analysis of human and
    mouse datasets. In addition, it contains pre-computed Pathway-GPS data for pathways
    in the KEGG and  Reactome pathway repositories and mechanisms for extracting GPS
    for user-supplied repositories.
