  summary: This package implements ridge fusion methodology for inverse covariance matrix estimation
    for use in quadratic discriminant analysis.  The package also contains function
    for model based clustering using ridge fusion for inverse matrix estimation, as
    well as tuning parameter selection functions.  We have also implemented QDA using
    joint inverse covariance estimation.
