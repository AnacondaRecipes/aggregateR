  summary: Transitioning from EQS to R for structural equation modeling (SEM) is made easier
    with a set of functions to convert .out files into R code. The EQS output can be
    converted into lavaan syntax and run in the R environment.  Other functions parse
    descriptive statistics and the covariance matrix from an EQS .out file.  A heat
    map plot of a covariance matrix is also included.
