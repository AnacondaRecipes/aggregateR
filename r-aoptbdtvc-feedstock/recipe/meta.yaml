  summary: 'A collection of functions to construct A-optimal block designs for comparing test
    treatments with one or more control(s). Mainly A-optimal balanced treatment incomplete
    block designs, weighted A-optimal balanced treatment incomplete block designs, A-optimal
    group divisible treatment designs and A-optimal balanced bipartite block designs
    can be constructed using the package. The designs are constructed using algorithms
    based on linear integer programming. To the best of our knowledge, these facilities
    to construct A-optimal block designs for comparing test treatments with one or more
