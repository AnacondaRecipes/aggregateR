  summary: A generic reference Bayesian analysis of unidimensional mixture distributions obtained
    by a location-scale parameterisation of the model is implemented. The including
    functions simulate and summarize posterior samples for location-scale mixture models
    using a weakly informative prior. There is no need to define priors for scale-location
    parameters except two hyperparameters in which are associated with a Dirichlet prior
    for weights and a simplex.
