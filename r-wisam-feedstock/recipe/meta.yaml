  summary: In the course of a genome-wide association study, the situation often arises that
    some phenotypes are known with greater precision than others. It could be that some
    individuals are known to harbor more micro-environmental variance than others. In
    the case of inbred strains of model organisms, it could be the case that more organisms
    were observed from some strains than others, so the strains with more organisms
    have better-estimated means. Package 'wISAM' handles this situation by allowing
    for weighting of each observation according to residual variance. Specifically,
    the 'weight' parameter to the function conduct_scan() takes the precision of each
    observation (one over the variance).
