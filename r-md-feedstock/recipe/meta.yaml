  summary: Selects bandwidth for the kernel density estimator with minimum distance method as
    proposed by Devroye and Lugosi (1996). The minimum distance method directly selects
    the optimal kernel density estimator from countably infinite kernel density estimators
    and indirectly selects the optimal bandwidth. This package selects the optimal bandwidth
    from finite kernel density estimators.
