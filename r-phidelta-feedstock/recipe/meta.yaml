  summary: Analysis of features by phi delta diagrams. In particular, functions for reading data
    and calculating phi and delta as well as the functionality to plot it. Moreover
    it is possible to do further analysis on the data by generating rankings. For more
    information on phi delta diagrams, see also Giuliano Armano (2015) <doi:10.1016/j.ins.2015.07.028>.
