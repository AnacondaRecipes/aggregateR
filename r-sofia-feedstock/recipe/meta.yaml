  summary: 'Software that leverages the capabilities of Circos by manipulating data, preparing
    configuration files, and running the Perl-native Circos directly from the R environment
    with minimal user intervention. Circos is a novel software that addresses the challenges
    in visualizing genetic data by creating circular ideograms composed of tracks of
    heatmaps, scatter plots, line plots, histograms, links between common markers, glyphs,
    text, and etc. Please see <http://www.circos.ca>. '
