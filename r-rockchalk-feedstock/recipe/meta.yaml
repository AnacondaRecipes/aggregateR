  summary: A collection of functions for interpretation and presentation of regression analysis.  These
    functions are used to produce the statistics lectures in <https://pj.freefaculty.org/guides/>.
    Includes regression diagnostics, regression tables, and plots of interactions and
    "moderator" variables. The emphasis is on "mean-centered" and "residual-centered"
    predictors. The vignette 'rockchalk' offers a fairly comprehensive overview.  The
    vignette 'Rstyle' has advice about coding in R.  The package title 'rockchalk' refers
    to our school motto, 'Rock Chalk Jayhawk, Go K.U.'.
