  summary: Provides functions to produce some circular plots for circular data, in a height-
    or area-proportional manner. They include barplots, smooth density plots, stacked
    dot plots, histograms, multi-class stacked smooth density plots, and multi-class
    stacked histograms. The new methodology for general area-proportional circular visualization
    is described in an article submitted (after revision) to Journal of Computational
    and Graphical Statistics.
