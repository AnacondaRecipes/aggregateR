  summary: Performs exploratory data analysis and variable screening for binary classification
    models using weight-of-evidence (WOE) and information value (IV). In order to make
    the package as efficient as possible, aggregations are done in data.table and creation
    of WOE vectors can be distributed across multiple cores. The package also supports
    exploration for uplift models (NWOE and NIV).
