  summary: Provides a class for multi-companion matrices with methods for arithmetic and factorization.  A
    method for generation of multi-companion matrices with prespecified spectral properties
    is provided, as well as some utilities for periodically correlated and multivariate
    time series models. See Boshnakov (2002) <doi:10.1016/S0024-3795(01)00475-X> and
