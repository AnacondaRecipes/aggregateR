  summary: 'Allows the computation of clustering coefficients for directed and weighted networks
    by using different approaches. It allows to compute clustering coefficients that
    are not present in ''igraph'' package. A description of clustering coefficients
    can be found in "Directed clustering in weighted networks: a new perspective", Clemente,
    G.P., Grassi, R. (2017), <doi:10.1016/j.chaos.2017.12.007>.'
