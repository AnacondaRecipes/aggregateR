  summary: 'Three games: proton, frequon and regression. Each one is a console-based data-crunching
    game for younger and older data scientists. Act as a data-hacker and find Slawomir
    Pietraszko''s credentials to the Proton server. In proton you have to solve four
    data-based puzzles to find the login and password. There are many ways to solve
    these puzzles. You may use loops, data filtering, ordering, aggregation or other
    tools. Only basics knowledge of R is required to play the game, yet the more functions
    you know, the more approaches you can try. In frequon you will help to perform statistical
    cryptanalytic attack on a corpus of ciphered messages. This time seven sub-tasks
    are pushing the bar much higher. Do you accept the challenge? In regression you
    will test your modeling skills in a series of eight sub-tasks. Try only if ANOVA
    is your close friend. It''s a part of Beta and Bit project. You will find more about
    the Beta and Bit project at <https://github.com/BetaAndBit/Charts>.'
