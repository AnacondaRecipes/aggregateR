  summary: 'Conventional methods for producing standard scores or percentiles in psychometrics
    or biometrics are often plagued with ''jumps'' or ''gaps'' (i.e., discontinuities)
    in norm tables and low confidence for assessing extreme scores. The continuous norming
    method introduced by A. Lenhard et al. (2016, <doi:10.1177/1073191116656437>; 2019,
    <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0222279>; 2021 <doi: 10.1177/0013164420928457>) estimates
    percentile development (e. g. over age) and generates continuous test norm scores
    on the basis of the raw data from standardization samples, without requiring assumptions
    about the distribution of the raw data: Norm scores are directly established from
    raw data by modeling the latter ones as a function of both percentile scores and
    an explanatory variable (e.g., age). The method minimizes bias arising from sampling
    and measurement error, while handling marked deviations from normality, addressing
    bottom or ceiling effects and capturing almost all of the variance in the original
    norm data sample. It includes procedures for post stratification of norm samples
    to overcome bias in data collection and to mitigate violations of representativeness.
