  summary: 'Conventional methods for producing standard scores in psychometrics or biometrics  are
    often plagued with "jumps" or "gaps" (i.e., discontinuities) in norm tables and
    low  confidence for assessing extreme scores. The continuous norming method introduced
    by A.  Lenhard et al. (2016), <doi:10.1177/1073191116656437>, generates continuous
    test norm  scores on the basis of the raw data from standardization samples, without
    requiring  assumptions about the distribution of the raw data: Norm scores are directly
    established  from raw data by modeling the latter ones as a function of both percentile
    scores and an  explanatory variable (e.g., age). The method minimizes bias arising
    from sampling and  measurement error, while handling marked deviations from normality,
    addressing bottom  or ceiling effects and capturing almost all of the variance in
    the original norm data  sample.'
