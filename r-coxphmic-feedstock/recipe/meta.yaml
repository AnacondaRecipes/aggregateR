  summary: Sparse estimation for Cox PH models is done via Minimum approximated Information Criterion
    (MIC) by Su, Wijayasinghe,  Fan, and Zhang (2016) <DOI:10.1111/biom.12484>. MIC
    mimics the best  subset selection using a penalized likelihood approach yet with
    no need  of a tuning parameter. The problem is further reformulated with a  re-parameterization
    step so that it reduces to one unconstrained non-convex yet smooth programming problem,
    which can be solved efficiently. Furthermore, the re-parameterization tactic yields
    an additional advantage in terms of circumventing post-selection inference.
