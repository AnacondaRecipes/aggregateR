  summary: Estimates average treatment effects using model average double robust (MA-DR) estimation.
    The MA-DR estimator is defined as weighted average of double robust estimators,
    where each double robust estimator corresponds to a specific choice of the outcome
    model and the propensity score model. The MA-DR estimator extend the desirable double
    robustness property by achieving consistency under the much weaker assumption that
    either the true propensity score model or the true outcome model be within a specified,
    possibly large, class of models.
