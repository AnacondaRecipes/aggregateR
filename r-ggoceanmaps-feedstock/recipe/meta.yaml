  summary: Allows plotting data on bathymetric maps using 'ggplot2'. Plotting oceanographic spatial
    data is made as simple as feasible, but also flexible for custom modifications.
    Data that contain geographic information from anywhere around the globe can be plotted
    on maps generated by the basemap() or qmap() functions using 'ggplot2' layers separated
    by the '+' operator. The package uses spatial shape- ('sf') and raster ('stars')
    files, geospatial packages for R to manipulate, and the 'ggplot2' package to plot
    these files. The package ships with low-resolution spatial data files and higher
    resolution files for detailed maps are stored in the 'ggOceanMapsLargeData' repository
    on GitHub and downloaded automatically when needed.
