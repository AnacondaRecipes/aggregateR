  summary: Use spectrophotometry measurements performed on insects as a way to infer pathogens
    virulence. Insect movements cause fluctuations in fluorescence signal, and functions
    are provided to estimate when the insect has died as the moment when variance in
    autofluorescence signal drops to zero. The package provides functions to obtain
    this estimate together with functions to import spectrophotometry data from a Biotek
    microplate reader. Details of the method are given in Parthuisot et al. (2018) <doi:10.1101/297929>.
