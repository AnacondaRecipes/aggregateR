  summary: A function (which uses a similar interface to the `glm' function) for the fitting
    of a Conway-Maxwell-Poisson GLM. There are also various methods for analysis of
    the model fit. The package also contains functions for the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson
    distribution in a similar interface to functions `dpois', `ppois' and `rpois'. The
    functions are generally quick, since the workhorse functions are written in C++
    (thanks to the Rcpp package).
