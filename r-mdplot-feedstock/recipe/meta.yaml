  summary: Provides automatization for plot generation succeeding common molecular dynamics analyses.
    This includes straightforward plots, such as RMSD (Root-Mean-Square-Deviation) and
    RMSF (Root-Mean-Square-Fluctuation) but also more sophisticated ones such as dihedral
    angle maps, hydrogen bonds, cluster bar plots and DSSP (Definition of Secondary
    Structure of Proteins) analysis. Currently able to load GROMOS, GROMACS and AMBER
    formats, respectively.
