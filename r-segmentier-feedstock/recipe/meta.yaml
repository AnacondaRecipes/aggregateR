  summary: A dynamic programming solution to segmentation based on maximization of arbitrary
    similarity measures within segments. The general idea, theory and this implementation
    are described in Machne, Murray & Stadler (2017) <doi:10.1038/s41598-017-12401-8>.
    In addition to the core algorithm, the package provides time-series processing and
    clustering functions as described in the publication. These are generally applicable
    where a `k-means` clustering yields meaningful results, and have been specifically
    developed for clustering of the Discrete Fourier Transform of periodic gene expression
    data (`circadian' or `yeast metabolic oscillations'). This clustering approach is
    outlined in the supplemental material of Machne & Murray (2012) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0037906>),
    and here is used as a basis of segment similarity measures. Notably, the time-series
    processing and clustering functions can also be used as stand-alone tools, independent
    of segmentation, e.g., for transcriptome data already mapped to genes.
