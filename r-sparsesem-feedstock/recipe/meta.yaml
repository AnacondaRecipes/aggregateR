  summary: 'Provides elastic net penalized maximum likelihood estimator for structural equation
    models (SEM). The package implements `lasso` and `elastic net` (l1/l2) penalized
    SEM and estimates the model parameters with an efficient block coordinate ascent
    algorithm that maximizes the penalized likelihood of the SEM.  Hyperparameters are
    inferred from cross-validation (CV).  A Stability Selection (STS) function is also
    available to provide accurate causal effect selection. The software achieves high
    accuracy performance through a `Network Generative Pre-trained Transformer` (Network
    GPT) Framework with two steps: 1) pre-trains the model to generate a complete (fully
    connected) graph; and 2) uses the complete graph as the initial state to fit the
    `elastic net` penalized SEM.'
