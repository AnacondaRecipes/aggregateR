  summary: 'Computation and visualization of Taxicab Correspondence Analysis, Choulakian (2006)
    <doi:10.1007/s11336-004-1231-4>.  Classical correspondence analysis (CA) is a statistical
    method to analyse 2-dimensional tables of positive numbers and is typically applied
    to contingency tables (Benzecri, J.-P. (1973). L''Analyse des Donnees. Volume II.
    L''Analyse des Correspondances. Paris, France: Dunod).  Classical CA is based on
    the Euclidean distance.  Taxicab CA is like classical CA but is based on the Taxicab
    or Manhattan distance.  For some tables, Taxicab CA gives more informative results
    than classical CA.'
