  summary: 'Performs bootstrap resampling for most models that update() works for. There are
    two primary functions: bootstrap_model() performs block resampling if random effects
    are present, and case resampling if not; bootstrap_ci() converts output from bootstrap
    model runs into confidence intervals and p-values. By default, bootstrap_model()
    calls bootstrap_ci().  Package motivated by Humphrey and Swingley (2018) <arXiv:1805.08670>.'
