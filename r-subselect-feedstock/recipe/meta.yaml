  summary: A collection of functions which (i) assess the quality of variable subsets as surrogates
    for a full data set, in either an exploratory data analysis or in the context of
    a multivariate linear model, and (ii) search for subsets which are optimal under
    various criteria. Theoretical support for the heuristic search methods and exploratory
    data analysis criteria is in Cadima, Cerdeira, Minhoto (2003, <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2003.11.001>).
    Theoretical support for the leap and bounds algorithm and the criteria for the general
    multivariate linear model is in Duarte Silva (2001, <doi:10.1006/jmva.2000.1920>).
    There is a package vignette "subselect", which includes additional references.
