  summary: 'Simulation and estimation of univariate and multivariate log-GARCH models. The main
    functions of the package are: lgarchSim(), mlgarchSim(), lgarch() and mlgarch().
    The first two functions simulate from a univariate and a multivariate log-GARCH
    model, respectively, whereas the latter two estimate a univariate and multivariate
    log-GARCH model, respectively.'
