  summary: S3 and S4 functions are implemented for spatial multi-site stochastic generation of
    daily time series of temperature and precipitation. These tools make use of Vector
    AutoRegressive models (VARs). The weather generator model is then saved as an object
    and is calibrated by daily instrumental "Gaussianized" time series through the 'vars'
    package tools. Once obtained this model, it can it can be used for weather generations
    and be adapted to work with several climatic monthly time series.
