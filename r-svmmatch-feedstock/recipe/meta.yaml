  summary: Causal effect estimation in observational data often requires identifying a set of
    untreated observations that are comparable to some treated group of interest.  This
    package provides a suite of functions for identifying such a set of observations
    and for implementing standard and new diagnostics tools.  The primary function,
    svmmatch(), uses support vector machines to identify a region of common support
    between treatment and control groups.  A sensitivity analysis, balance checking,
    and assessment of the region of overlap between treated and control groups is included.  The
    Bayesian implementation allows for recovery of uncertainty estimates for the treatment
    effect and all other parameters.
