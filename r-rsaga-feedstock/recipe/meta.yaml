  summary: Provides access to geocomputing and terrain analysis functions of the geographical
    information system (GIS) 'SAGA' (System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses) from
    within R by running the command line version of SAGA. This package furthermore provides
    several R functions for handling ASCII grids, including a flexible framework for
    applying local functions (including predict methods of fitted models) and focal
    functions to multiple grids. SAGA GIS is available under GPL-2 / LGPL-2 licences
    from <https://sourceforge.net/projects/saga-gis/>.
