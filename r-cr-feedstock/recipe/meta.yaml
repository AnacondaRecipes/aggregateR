  summary: This package contains R-functions to perform power calculation in a group sequential
    clinical trial with censored survival data and possibly unequal patient allocation
    between treatment and control groups. The fuctions can also be used to determine
    the study duration in a clinical trial with censored survival data as the sum of
    the accrual duration, which determines the sample size in a traditional sense, and
    the follow-up duration, which more or less controls the number of events to be observed.
    This package also contains R functions and methods to display the computed results.
