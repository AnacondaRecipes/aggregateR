  summary: "Implements the Classification-based on Association Rules (CBA) (Bing Liu, Wynne Hsu,\tYiming
    Ma (1999) <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3000292.3000305>) algorithm for association
    rule classification (ARC). The package also contains several convenience methods
    that allow to automatically set CBA parameters (minimum confidence, minimum support)
    and it also natively handles numeric attributes by integrating a pre-discretization
    step. The rule generation phase is handled by the 'arules' package. To further decrease
    the size of the CBA models produced by the 'arc' package, postprocessing by the
    'qCBA' package is suggested. QCBA package can be obtained from CRAN archive or from
    <https://github.com/kliegr/QCBA>."
