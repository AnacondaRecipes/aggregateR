  summary: "Implements the Classification-based on Association Rules (CBA) (Bing Liu, Wynne Hsu,\tYiming
    Ma (1999) <http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3000292.3000305>) algorithm for association
    rule classification (ARC). The package also contains several convenience methods
    that allow to automatically set CBA parameters (minimum confidence, minimum support)
    and it also natively handles numeric attributes by integrating a pre-discretization
    step. The rule generation phase is handled by the 'arules' package.  To further
    decrease the size of the CBA models produced by the 'arc' package, postprocessing
    by the  'qCBA' package is suggested."
