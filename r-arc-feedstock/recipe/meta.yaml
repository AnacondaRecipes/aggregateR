  summary: Implements the Classification-based on Association Rules (CBA) algorithm for association
    rule classification. The package, also described in Hahsler et al. (2019) <doi:10.32614/RJ-2019-048>,
    contains several convenience methods that allow to automatically set CBA parameters
    (minimum confidence, minimum support) and it also natively handles numeric attributes
    by integrating a pre-discretization step. The rule generation phase is handled by
    the 'arules' package. To further decrease the size of the CBA models produced by
    the 'arc' package, postprocessing by the 'qCBA' package is suggested.
