  license: MIT
  summary: Creates a 3D data cube view of a RasterStack/Brick, typically a  collection/array
    of RasterLayers (along z-axis) with the same geographical  extent (x and y dimensions)
    and resolution, provided by package 'raster'.  Slices through each dimension (x/y/z),
    freely adjustable in location,  are mapped to the visible sides of the cube. The
    cube can be freely rotated.  Zooming and panning can be used to focus on different
    areas of the cube.
