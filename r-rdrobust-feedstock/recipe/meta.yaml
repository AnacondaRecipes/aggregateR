  summary: "Regression-discontinuity (RD) designs are quasi-experimental research designs popular
    in social, behavioral and natural sciences. The RD design is usually employed to
    study the (local) causal effect of a treatment, intervention or policy. This package
    provides tools for data-driven graphical and analytical statistical inference in
    RD\tdesigns: rdrobust() to construct local-polynomial point estimators and robust
    confidence intervals for average treatment effects at the \tcutoff in Sharp, Fuzzy
    and Kink RD settings, rdbwselect() to perform bandwidth selection for the different
    procedures implemented, and rdplot() to conduct exploratory data analysis (RD plots)."
