  summary: Fit linear and cox models regularized with net (L1 and Laplacian), elastic-net (L1
    and L2) or lasso (L1) penalty, and their adaptive forms, such as adaptive lasso
    and net adjusting for signs of linked coefficients. In addition, it treats the number
    of non-zero coefficients as another tuning parameter and simultaneously selects
    with the regularization parameter. The package uses one-step coordinate descent
    algorithm and runs extremely fast by taking into account the sparsity structure
    of coefficients.
