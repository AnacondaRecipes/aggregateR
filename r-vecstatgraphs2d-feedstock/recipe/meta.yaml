  summary: 'A 2D statistical analysis is performed, both numerical and graphical, of a set of
    vectors. Since a vector has two components (module and azimuth) vector analysis
    is performed in three stages: modules are analyzed by means of linear statistics,
    azimuths are analyzed by circular statistics, and the joint analysis of modules
    and azimuths is done using density maps that allow detecting another distribution
    properties (i.e. anisotropy) and outliers. Tests and circular statistic parameters
    have associated a full range of graphing: histograms, maps of distributions, point
    maps, vector maps, density maps, distribution modules and azimuths.'
