  summary: Implementation of the web-based 'Practical Meta-Analysis Effect Size Calculator' from
    David B. Wilson (<http://www.campbellcollaboration.org/escalc/html/EffectSizeCalculator-Home.php>)
    in R. Based on the input, the effect size can be returned as standardized mean difference,
    Cohen's f, Hedges' g, Pearson's r or Fisher's transformation z, odds ratio or log
    odds, or eta squared effect size.
