  summary: Assists actuaries and other insurance modellers in pricing, reserving and capital
    modelling for non-life insurance and reinsurance modelling. Provides functions that
    help model excess levels, capping and pure Incurred but not reported claims (pure
    IBNR). Includes capped mean, exposure curves and increased limit factor curves (ILFs)
    for LogNormal, Gamma, Pareto, Sliced LogNormal-Pareto and Sliced Gamma-Pareto distributions.
    Includes mean, probability density function (pdf), cumulative probability function
    (cdf) and inverse cumulative probability function for Sliced LogNormal-Pareto and
    Sliced Gamma-Pareto distributions. Includes calculating pure IBNR exposure with
    LogNormal and Gamma distribution for reporting delay.
