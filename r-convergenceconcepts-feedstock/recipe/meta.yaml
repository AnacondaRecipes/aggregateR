  summary: This is a pedagogical package, designed to help students understanding convergence
    of random variables. It provides a way to investigate interactively various modes
    of convergence (in probability, almost surely, in law and in mean) of a sequence
    of i.i.d. random variables. Visualisation of simulated sample paths is possible
    through interactive plots. The approach is illustrated by examples and exercises
    through the function 'investigate', as described in Lafaye de Micheaux and Liquet
    (2009) <doi:10.1198/tas.2009.0032>. The user can study his/her own sequences of
    random variables.
