  summary: Extends the glmnet package with "relaxation", done by running glmnet once on the entire
    predictor matrix, then again on each different subset of variables from along the
    regularization path. Relaxation may lead to improved prediction accuracy for truly
    sparse data generating models, as well as fewer false positives (i.e. fewer noncontributing
    predictors in the final model). Penalty may be lasso (alpha = 1) or elastic net
    (0 < alpha < 1). For this version, family may be "gaussian" or "binomial" only.
    Takes advantage of fast FORTRAN code from the glmnet package.
