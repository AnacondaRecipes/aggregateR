  summary: S4 classes and methods to deal with fuzzy numbers. They allow for computing any arithmetic
    operations (e.g., by using the Zadeh extension principle), performing approximation
    of arbitrary fuzzy numbers by trapezoidal and piecewise linear ones, preparing plots
    for publications, computing possibility and necessity values for comparisons, etc.
