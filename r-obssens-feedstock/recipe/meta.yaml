  summary: Observational studies are limited in that there could be an unmeasured variable related
    to both the response variable and the primary predictor.  If this unmeasured variable
    were included in the analysis it would change the relationship (possibly changing
    the conclusions).  Sensitivity analysis is a way to see how much of a relationship
    needs to exist with the unmeasured variable before the conclusions change.  This
    package provides tools for doing a sensitivity analysis for regression (linear,
    logistic, and cox) style models.
