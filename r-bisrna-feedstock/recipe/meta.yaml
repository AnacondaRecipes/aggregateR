  summary: 'Bisulfite-treated RNA non-conversion in a set of samples is analysed as follows :
    each sample''s non-conversion distribution is identified to a Poisson distribution.
    P-values adjusted for multiple testing are calculated in each sample. Combined non-conversion
    P-values and standard errors are calculated on the intersection of the set of samples.
