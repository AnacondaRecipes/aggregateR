  summary: "Data with irregular spatial support, such as runoff related data or data from administrative
    units, can with 'rtop' be interpolated to locations without observations with the
    top-kriging method. A description of the package is given by Sk\xF8ien et al (2014)
    <doi:10.1016/j.cageo.2014.02.009>."
