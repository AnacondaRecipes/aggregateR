  summary: 'Rough Sets were introduced by Zdzislaw Pawlak on his book "Rough Sets: Theoretical
    Aspects of Reasoning About Data". Rough Sets provide a formal method to approximate
    crisp sets when the set-element belonging relationship is either known or undetermined.
    This enables the use of Rough Sets for reasoning about incomplete or contradictory
    knowledge. A decision table is a prescription of the decisions to make given some
    conditions. Such decision tables can be reduced without losing prescription ability.
    This package provides the classes and methods for knowledge reduction from decision
    tables as presented in the chapter 7 of the aforementioned book. This package provides
    functions for calculating the both the discernibility matrix and the essential parts
    of decision tables.'
