  summary: Compute the confidence interval of the population mean with one sample or of the difference
    of population means of two samples from normal distributions or t-distributions.Compute
    the confidence interval of population variance with one sample or of the difference
    of population variances of two samples by chi-square tests.Test for population mean
    or the differences of two normal samples under normality with the given null hypothesis
    H0,which depends on the user,so that he can know if he can reject H0 or not at the
    significance level alpha.Do the chi-square tests with one or two samples which have
    multinomial distributions by using an approximate chi-square distribution when n
    is large enough.
