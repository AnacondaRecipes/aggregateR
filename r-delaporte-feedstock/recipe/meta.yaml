  summary: Provides probability mass, distribution, quantile, random-variate generation, and
    method-of-moments parameter-estimation functions for the Delaporte distribution.
    The Delaporte is a discrete probability distribution which can be considered the
    convolution of a negative binomial distribution with a Poisson distribution. Alternatively,
    it can be considered a counting distribution with both Poisson and negative binomial
    components. It has been studied in actuarial science as a frequency distribution
    which has more variability than the Poisson, but less than the negative binomial.
