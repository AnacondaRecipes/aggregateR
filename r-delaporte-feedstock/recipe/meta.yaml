  summary: Provides probability mass, distribution, quantile, random-variate generation, and
    method-of-moments parameter-estimation functions for the Delaporte distribution
    with parameterization based on Vose (2008) <isbn:9780470512845>. The Delaporte is
    a discrete probability distribution which can be considered the convolution of a
    negative binomial distribution with a Poisson distribution. Alternatively, it can
    be considered a counting distribution with both Poisson and negative binomial components.
    It has been studied in actuarial science as a frequency distribution which has more
    variability than the Poisson, but less than the negative binomial.
