  summary: Creation of imprecise classification trees. They rely on probability estimation within
    each node by means of either the imprecise Dirichlet model or the nonparametric
    predictive inference approach. The splitting variable is selected by the strategy
    presented in Fink and Crossman (2013) <http://www.sipta.org/isipta13/index.php?id=paper&paper=014.html>,
    but also the original imprecise information gain of Abellan and Moral (2003) <doi:10.1002/int.10143>
    is covered.
