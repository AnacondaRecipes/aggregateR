  summary: User friendly functions for power and sample size analysis at one-way and two-way
    ANOVA settings take either effect size or delta and sigma as arguments. They are
    designed for both one-way and two-way ANOVA settings. In addition, a function for
    plotting power curves is available for power comparison, which can be easily visualized
    by statisticians and clinical researchers.
