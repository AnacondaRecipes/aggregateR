  summary: A parser and a writer for 'WEKA' Attribute-Relation File Format <https://waikato.github.io/weka-wiki/arff_stable/>
    in pure R, with no dependencies.  As opposed to other R implementations, this package
    can read standard (dense) as well as sparse files, i.e. those where each row does
    only contain  nonzero components. Unlike 'RWeka', 'yarr' does not require any 'Java'
    installation nor is dependent on external software. This implementation is generalized
    from  those in packages 'mldr' and 'mldr.datasets'.
