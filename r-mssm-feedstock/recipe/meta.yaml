  summary: Provides methods to perform parameter estimation and make analysis of multivariate
    observed outcomes through time which depends on a latent state variable. All methods
    scale well in the dimension of the observed outcomes at each time point. The package
    contains an implementation of a Laplace approximation, particle filters like suggested
    by Lin, Zhang, Cheng, & Chen (2005) <doi:10.1198/016214505000000349>, and the gradient
    and observed information matrix approximation suggested by Poyiadjis, Doucet, &
    Singh (2011) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asq062>.
