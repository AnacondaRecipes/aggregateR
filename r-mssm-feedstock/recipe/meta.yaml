  summary: Provides methods to perform parameter estimation and  make analysis of multivariate
    observed outcomes through time which depends  on a latent state variable. All methods
    scale well in the dimension  of the observed outcomes at each time point. The package
    contains an  implementation of a Laplace approximation, particle filters like  suggested
    by Lin, Zhang, Cheng, & Chen (2005) <doi:10.1198/016214505000000349>, and the gradient
    and observed information matrix approximation suggested by Poyiadjis, Doucet, &
    Singh (2011)  <doi:10.1093/biomet/asq062>.
