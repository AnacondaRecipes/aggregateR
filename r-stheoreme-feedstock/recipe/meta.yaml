  summary: Functions implementing the procedure of entropy comparison between two data samples
    after the renormalization of respective probability distributions with the algorithm
    designed by Klimontovich (Zeitschrift fur Physik B Condensed Matter. 1987, Volume
    66, Issue 1, pp 125-127) and extended by Anishchenko (Proc. SPIE 2098, Computer
    Simulation in Nonlinear Optics. 1994, pp.130-136).  The package also includes data
    preparation tools which can also be used separately for various applications.
