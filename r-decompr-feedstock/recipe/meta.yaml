  summary: Two global-value-chain decompositions are implemented. Firstly, the Wang-Wei-Zhu (Wang,
    Wei, and Zhu, 2013) algorithm splits bilateral gross exports into 16 value-added
    components. Secondly, the Leontief decomposition (default) derives the value added
    origin of exports by country and industry, which is also based on Wang, Wei, and
    Zhu (Wang, Z., S.-J. Wei, and K. Zhu. 2013. "Quantifying International Production
    Sharing at the Bilateral and Sector Levels.").
