  summary: 'Three global value chain (GVC) decompositions are implemented. The Leontief decomposition
    derives the value added origin of exports by country and industry as in Hummels,
    Ishii and Yi (2001). The Koopman, Wang and Wei (2014) decomposition splits country-level
    exports into 9 value added components, and the Wang, Wei and Zhu (2013) decomposition
    splits bilateral exports into 16 value added components. Various GVC indicators
    based on these decompositions are computed in the complimentary ''gvc'' package.
