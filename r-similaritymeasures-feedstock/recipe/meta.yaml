  summary: 'Functions to run and assist four different similarity measures. The similarity measures
    included are: longest common subsequence (LCSS), Frechet distance, edit distance
    and dynamic time warping (DTW). Each of these similarity measures can be calculated
    from two n-dimensional trajectories, both in matrix form.'
