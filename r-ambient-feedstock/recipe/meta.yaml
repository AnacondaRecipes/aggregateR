  summary: Generation of natural looking noise has many application within simulation, procedural
    generation, and art, to name a few. The 'ambient' package provides an interface
    to the 'FastNoise' C++ library and allows for efficient generation of perlin, simplex,
    worley, cubic, value, and white noise with optional pertubation in either 2, 3,
    or 4 (in case of simplex and white noise) dimensions.
