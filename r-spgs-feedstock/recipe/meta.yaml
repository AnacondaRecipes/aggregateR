  summary: A collection of statistical hypothesis tests and other techniques for identifying
    certain spatial relationships/phenomena in DNA sequences. In particular, it provides
    tests and graphical methods for determining whether or not DNA sequences comply
    with Chargaff's second parity rule or exhibit purine-pyrimidine parity. In addition,
    there are functions for efficiently simulating discrete state space Markov chains
    and testing arbitrary symbolic sequences of symbols for the presence of first-order
    Markovianness. Also, it has functions for counting words/k-mers (and cylinder patterns)
    in arbitrary symbolic sequences. Functions which take a DNA sequence as input can
    handle sequences stored as SeqFastadna objects from the 'seqinr' package.
