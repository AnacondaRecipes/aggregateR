  summary: Implements Affinity Propagation clustering introduced by Frey and Dueck (2007) <DOI:10.1126/science.1136800>.
    The algorithms are largely analogous to the 'Matlab' code published by Frey and
    Dueck. The package further provides leveraged affinity propagation and an algorithm
    for exemplar-based agglomerative clustering that can also be used to join clusters
    obtained from affinity propagation. Various plotting functions are available for
    analyzing clustering results.
