  summary: For a sequence of event occurence times, we are interested in finding subsequences
    in it that are too "regular". We define regular as being significantly different
    from a homogeneous Poisson process. The departure from the Poisson process is measured
    using a L1 distance. See Di and Perlman 2007 for more details.
