  summary: Provided are Computational methods for Immune Cell-type Subsets, including:(1) DCQ
    (Digital Cell Quantifier) to infer global dynamic changes in immune cell quantities
    within a complex tissue; and (2) VoCAL (Variation of Cell-type Abundance Loci) a
    deconvolution-based method that utilizes transcriptome data to infer the quantities
    of immune-cell types, and then uses these quantitative traits to uncover the underlying
    DNA loci.
