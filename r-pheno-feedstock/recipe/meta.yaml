  summary: Provides some easy-to-use functions for time series analyses of (plant-) phenological
    data sets. These functions mainly deal with the estimation of combined phenological
    time series and are usually wrappers for functions that are already implemented
    in other R packages adapted to the special structure of phenological data and the
    needs of phenologists. Some date conversion functions to handle Julian dates are
    also provided.
