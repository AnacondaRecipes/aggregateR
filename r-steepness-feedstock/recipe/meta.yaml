  summary: steepness is a package that computes steepness as a property of dominance hierarchies.
    Steepness is defined as the absolute slope of the straight line fitted to the normalized
    David's scores. The normalized David's scores can be obtained on the basis of dyadic
    dominance indices corrected for chance or by means of proportions of wins. Given
    an observed sociomatrix, it computes hierarchy's steepness and estimates statistical
    significance by means of a randomization test.
