  summary: The steepness package computes steepness as a property of dominance hierarchies. Steepness
    is defined as the absolute slope of the straight line fitted to the normalized David's
    scores. The normalized David's scores can be obtained on the basis of dyadic dominance
    indices corrected for chance or by means of proportions of wins. Given an observed
    sociomatrix, it computes hierarchy's steepness and estimates statistical significance
    by means of a randomization test.
