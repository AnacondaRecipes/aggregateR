  summary: Classification performance metrics that are derived from the ROC curve of a classifier.
    The package includes the H-measure performance metric as described in <http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-009-5119-5>,
    which computes the minimum total misclassification cost, integrating over any uncertainty
    about the relative misclassification costs, as per a user-defined prior. It also
    offers a one-stop-shop for other scalar metrics of performance, including sensitivity,
    specificity and many others, and also offers plotting tools for ROC curves and related
    statistics.
