  summary: Developed to perform the estimation and inference for regression coefficient parameters
    in longitudinal marginal models using the method of quadratic inference functions.
    Like generalized estimating equations, this method is also a quasi-likelihood inference
    method. It has been showed that the method gives consistent estimators of the regression
    coefficients even if the correlation structure is misspecified, and it is more efficient
    than GEE when the correlation structure is misspecified. Based on Qu, A., Lindsay,
    B.G. and Li, B. (2000) <doi:10.1093/biomet/87.4.823>.
