  summary: Provides a simple mechanism to specify a symmetric block diagonal matrices (often  used
    for covariance matrices).  This is based on the domain specific language implemented
    in 'nlmixr' but expanded to create matrices in R generally instead of specifying
    parts of matrices to estimate.
