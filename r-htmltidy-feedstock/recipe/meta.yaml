  summary: HTML documents can be beautiful and pristine. They can also be wretched, evil, malformed
    demon-spawn. Now, you can tidy up that HTML and XHTML before processing it with
    your favorite angle-bracket crunching tools, going beyond the limited tidying that
    'libxml2' affords in the 'XML' and 'xml2' packages and taming even the ugliest HTML
    code generated by the likes of Google Docs and Microsoft Word. It's also possible
    to use the functions provided to format or "pretty print" HTML content as it is
    being tidied. Utilities are also included that make it   possible to view formatted
    and "pretty printed" HTML/XML content from HTML/XML document objects, nodes, node
    sets and plain character HTML/XML using 'vkbeautify' (by Vadim Kiryukhin) and 'highlight.js'
    (by Ivan Sagalaev). Also (optionally) enables filtering of nodes via XPath or viewing
    an HTML/XML document in "tree" view using 'xml-viewer' (by Julian Gruber). See <https://github.com/vkiryukhin/vkBeautify>
    and  <https://github.com/juliangruber/xml-viewer> for more information about 'vkbeautify'
    and 'xml-viewer', respectively.
