  summary: "The unique function of this package allows representing in a single graph the relative
    occurrence and co-occurrence of events measured in a sample.  As examples, the package
    was applied to describe the occurrence and co-occurrence of different species of
    bacterial or viral symbionts infecting arthropods at the individual level. The graphics
    allows determining the prevalence of each symbiont and the patterns of multiple
    infections (i.e. how different symbionts share or not the same individual hosts).
    \ We named the package after the famous painter as the graphical output recalls
    Mondrian\u2019s paintings."
