  summary: "Provides confidence intervals in least-squares regressions when the variable of interest
    has a shift-share structure, and in instrumental variables regressions when the
    instrument has a shift-share structure. The confidence intervals implement the AKM
    and AKM0 methods developed in Ad\xE3o, Koles\xE1r, and Morales (2019) <doi:10.1093/qje/qjz025>."
