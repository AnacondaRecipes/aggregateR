  summary: Exports two functions implementing multi-way clustering using the method suggested
    by Cameron, Gelbach, & Miller (2011) and cluster (or block) bootstrapping for estimating
    variance-covariance matrices. Normal one and two-way clustering matches the results
    of other common statistical packages.  Missing values are handled transparently
    and rudimentary parallelization support is provided.
