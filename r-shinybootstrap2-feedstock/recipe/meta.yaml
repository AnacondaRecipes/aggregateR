  summary: Provides Bootstrap 2 web components for use with the Shiny package. With versions
    of Shiny prior to 0.11, these Bootstrap 2 components were included as part of the
    package. Later versions of Shiny include Bootstrap 3, so the Bootstrap 2 components
    have been moved into this package for those uses who rely on features specific to
    Bootstrap 2.
