  summary: Provides a function for distribution free control chart based on the change point
    model, for multivariate statistical process control. The main constituent of the
    chart is the energy test that focuses on the discrepancy between empirical characteristic
    functions of two random vectors. This new control chart highlights in three aspects.
    Firstly, it is distribution free, requiring no knowledge of the random processes.
    Secondly, this control chart can monitor mean and variance simultaneously. Thirdly
    it is devised for multivariate time series which is more practical in real data
    application. Fourthly, it is designed for online detection (Phase II), which is
    central for real time surveillance of stream data. For more information please refer
    to O. Okhrin and Y.F. Xu (2017) <https://github.com/YafeiXu/working_paper/raw/master/CPM102.pdf>.
