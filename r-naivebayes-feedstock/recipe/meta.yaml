  summary: 'In this implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier following class conditional
    distributions are available: Bernoulli, Categorical, Gaussian, Poisson and non-parametric
    representation of the class conditional density estimated via Kernel Density Estimation.
    Implemented classifiers handle missing data and can take advantage of sparse data.'
