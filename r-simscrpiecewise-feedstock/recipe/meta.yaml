  summary: Contains two functions for simulating survival data from piecewise exponential hazards
    with a proportional hazards adjustment for covariates. The first function SimUNIVPiecewise
    simulates univariate survival data based on a piecewise exponential hazard, covariate
    matrix and true regression vector. The second function SimSCRPiecewise semi-competing
    risks data based on three piecewise exponential hazards, three true regression vectors
    and three matrices of patient covariates (which can be different or the same). This
    simulates from the Semi-Markov model of Lee et al (2015) given patient covariates,
    regression parameters, patient frailties and baseline hazard functions.
