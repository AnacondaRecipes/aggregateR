  summary: Construct and plot objective hierarchies and associated value and utility functions.  Evaluate
    the values and utilities and visualize the results as colored objective hierarchies
    or tables.  Visualize uncertainty by plotting median and quantile intervals within
    the nodes of objective hierarchies. Get numerical results of the evaluations in
    standard R data types for further processing.
