  summary: 'Estimates the log hazard ratio associated with a binary exposure using a Cox PH model
    weighted by the propensity score.  Propensity model is estimated using a simple
    logistic regression.  Variance estimation takes into account the propensity score
    estimation step with the method proposed by Hajage et al. (2018) <doi:10.1002/bimj.201700330>.  Both
    the average treatment effect on the overall (ATE) or the treated (ATT) population
    can be estimated.  For the ATE estimation, both unstabilized and stabilized weights
    can be used. '
