  summary: Computes large sample confidence intervals of Liu and Hudgens (2014), exact confidence
    intervals of Tchetgen Tchetgen and VanderWeele (2012), and exact confidence intervals
    of Rigdon and Hudgens (2014) for treatment effects on a binary outcome in two-stage
    randomized experiments with interference.
