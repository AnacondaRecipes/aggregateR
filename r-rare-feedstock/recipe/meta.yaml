  summary: Implementation of an alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm for fitting
    a linear model with tree-based lasso regularization,  which is proposed in Algorithm
    1 of Yan and Bien (2018) <arXiv:1803.06675>.  The package allows efficient model
    fitting on the entire 2-dimensional  regularization path for large datasets. The
    complete set of functions  also makes the entire process of tuning regularization
    parameters and  visualizing results hassle-free.
