  summary: 'Calculate endogenous network effects in event sequences and fit relational event
    models (REM): Using network event sequences (where each tie between a sender and
    a target in a network is time-stamped), REMs can measure how networks form and evolve
    over time. Endogenous patterns such as popularity effects, inertia, similarities,
    cycles or triads can be calculated and analyzed over time.'
