  summary: A central decision in a parametric regression is how to specify the relation between
    an dependent variable and each explanatory variable. This package provides a semi-parametric
    tool for comparing different transformations of an  explanatory variables in a parametric
    regression. The functions is relevant in a situation, where you would use a box-cox
    or Box-Tidwell transformations.  In contrast to the classic power-transformations,
    the methods in this package allows for  theoretical driven user input and the possibility
    to compare with a non-parametric transformation.
