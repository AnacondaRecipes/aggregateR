  summary: For multiple full/partial ranking lists, R package 'ExtMallows' can (1) detect whether
    the input ranking lists are over-correlated, and (2) use the Mallows model or extended
    Mallows model to integrate the ranking lists, and (3) use hierarchical extended
    Mallows model for rank integration if there are groups of over-correlated ranking
    lists.
