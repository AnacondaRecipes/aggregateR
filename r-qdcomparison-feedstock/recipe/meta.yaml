  summary: Allows practitioners to determine (i) if two univariate distributions (which can be
    continuous, discrete, or even mixed) are equal, (ii) how two distributions differ
    (shape differences, e.g., location, scale, etc.), and (iii) where two distributions
    differ (at which quantiles), all using nonparametric LP statistics. The primary
    reference is Jungreis, D. (2019, Technical Report).
