  summary: Generic function for estimating positron emission tomography (PET) neuroreceptor occupancies
    from the total volumes of distribution of a set of regions of interest. Fittings
    methods include the simple 'reference region' and 'ordinary least squares' (sometimes
    known as occupancy plot) methods, as well as the more efficient 'restricted maximum
    likelihood estimation'.
