  summary: "Functions to calculate exact critical values, statistical power, expected time to
    signal, and required sample sizes for performing exact sequential analysis. All
    these\tcalculations can be done for either Poisson or binomial data, for continuous
    or group sequential analyses, and for different types of rejection boundaries. In
    case of group sequential analyses, the group sizes do not have to be specified in
    advance and the alpha spending can be arbitrarily settled."
