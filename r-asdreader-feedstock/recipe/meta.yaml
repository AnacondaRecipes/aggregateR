  summary: A simple driver that reads binary data created by the ASD Inc. portable spectrometer
    instruments, such as the FieldSpec (for more information, see <http://www.asdi.com/products/fieldspec-spectroradiometers>).
    Spectral data can be extracted from the ASD files as raw (DN), white reference,
    radiance, or reflectance. Additionally, the metadata information contained in the
    ASD file header can also be accessed.
