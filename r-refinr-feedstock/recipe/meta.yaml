  summary: These functions take a character vector as input, identify and cluster similar values,
    and then merge clusters together so their values become identical. The functions
    are an implementation of the key collision and ngram fingerprint algorithms from
    the open source tool Open Refine <https://openrefine.org/>. More info on key collision
    and ngram fingerprint can be found here <https://docs.openrefine.org/next/technical-reference/clustering-in-depth/>.
