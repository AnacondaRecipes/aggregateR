  summary: A set of R functions for calculating sample size requirements using three different
    Bayesian criteria in the context of designing an experiment to estimate a normal
    mean or the difference between two normal means.  Functions for calculation of required
    sample sizes for the Average Length Criterion, the Average Coverage Criterion and
    the Worst Outcome Criterion in the context of normal means are provided. Functions
    for both the fully Bayesian and the mixed Bayesian/likelihood approaches are provided.
