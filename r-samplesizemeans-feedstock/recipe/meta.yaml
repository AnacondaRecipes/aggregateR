  summary: "Sample size requirements calculation using three different Bayesian criteria in the
    context of designing an experiment to estimate a normal mean or the difference between
    two normal means.  Functions for calculation of required sample sizes for the Average
    Length Criterion, the Average Coverage Criterion and the Worst Outcome Criterion
    in the context of normal means are provided. Functions for both the fully Bayesian
    and the mixed Bayesian/likelihood approaches are provided. For reference see Joseph
    L. and B\xE9lisle P. (1997) <https://www.jstor.org/stable/2988525>."
