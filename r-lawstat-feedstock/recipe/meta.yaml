  summary: Statistical tests widely utilized in biostatistics, public policy, and law. Along
    with the well-known tests for equality of means and variances, randomness, and measures
    of relative variability, the package contains new robust tests of symmetry, omnibus
    and directional tests of normality, and their graphical counterparts such as robust
    QQ plot, robust trend tests for variances, etc. All implemented tests and methods
    are illustrated by simulations and real-life examples from legal statistics, economics,
    and biostatistics.
