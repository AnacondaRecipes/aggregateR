  summary: Supply functions for the creation and handling of missing data as well as tools to
    evaluate missing data methods. Nearly all possibilities of generating missing data
    discussed by Santos et al. (2019) <doi:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2891360> and some additional
    are implemented.  Functions are supplied to compare parameter estimates and imputed
    values to true values to evaluate missing data methods. Evaluations of these types
    are done, for example, by Cetin-Berber et al. (2019) <doi:10.1177/0013164418805532>
    and Kim et al. (2005) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bth499>.
