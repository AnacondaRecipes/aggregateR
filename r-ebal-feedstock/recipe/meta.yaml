  summary: Package implements entropy balancing, a data preprocessing procedure that allows users
    to reweight a dataset such that the covariate distributions in the reweighted data
    satisfy a set of user specified moment conditions. This can be useful to create
    balanced samples in observational studies with a binary treatment where the control
    group data can be reweighted to match the covariate moments in the treatment group.
    Entropy balancing can also be used to reweight a survey sample to known characteristics
    from a target population.
