  summary: Package implements entropy balancing, a data preprocessing procedure described in
    Hainmueller (2008, <doi:10.1093/pan/mpr025>) that allows users to reweight a dataset
    such that the covariate distributions in the reweighted data satisfy a set of user
    specified moment conditions. This can be useful to create balanced samples in observational
    studies with a binary treatment where the control group data can be reweighted to
    match the covariate moments in the treatment group. Entropy balancing can also be
    used to reweight a survey sample to known characteristics from a target population.
