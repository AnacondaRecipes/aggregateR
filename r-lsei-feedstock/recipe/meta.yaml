  summary: It contains functions that solve least squares linear regression problems under linear
    equality/inequality constraints. Functions for solving quadratic programming problems
    are also available, which transform such problems into least squares ones first.
    It is developed based on the 'Fortran' program of Lawson and Hanson (1974, 1995),
    which is public domain and available at <http://www.netlib.org/lawson-hanson>.
