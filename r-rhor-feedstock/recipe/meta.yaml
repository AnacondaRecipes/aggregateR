  summary: 'Rho is used to test the generalization of inter rater reliability (IRR) statistics.
    Calculating rho starts by generating a large number of simulated, fully-coded data
    sets: a sizable collection of hypothetical populations, all of which have a kappa
    value below a given threshold -- which indicates unacceptable agreement. Then kappa
    is calculated on a sample from each of those sets in the collection to see if it
    is equal to or higher than the kappa in then real sample. If less than five percent
    of the distribution of samples from the simulated data sets is greater than actual
    observed kappa, the null hypothesis is rejected and one can conclude that if the
    two raters had coded the rest of the data, we would have acceptable agreement (kappa
    above the threshold).'
