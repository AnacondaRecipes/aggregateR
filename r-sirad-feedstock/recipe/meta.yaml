  summary: Calculating daily global solar radiation at horizontal surface using several well-known
    models (i.e. Angstrom-Prescott, Supit-Van Kappel, Hargreaves, Bristow and Campbell,
    and Mahmood-Hubbard), and model calibration based on ground-truth data, and (3)
    model auto-calibration. The FAO Penmann-Monteith equation to calculate evapotranspiration
    is also included.
