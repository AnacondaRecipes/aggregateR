  summary: Interface for working with large matrices stored in files, not in computer memory.
    Supports multiple non-character data types (double, integer, logical and raw) of
    various sizes (e.g. 8 and 4 byte real values). Access to parts of the matrix is
    done by indexing, exactly as with usual R matrices. Supports very large matrices.
    Tested on multi-terabyte matrices. Allows for more than 2^32 rows or columns. Allows
    for quick addition of extra columns to a filematrix. Cross-platform as the package
    has R code only.
