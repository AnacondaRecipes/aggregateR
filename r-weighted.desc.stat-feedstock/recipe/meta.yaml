  summary: Weighted descriptive statistics is the discipline of quantitatively describing the
    main features of real-valued fuzzy data which usually given from a fuzzy population.
    One can summarize this special kind of fuzzy data numerically or graphically using
    this package. To interpret some of the properties of one or several sets of real-valued
    fuzzy data, numerically summarize is possible by some weighted statistics which
    are designed in this package such as mean, variance, covariance and correlation
    coefficent. Also, graphically interpretation can be given by weighted histogram
    and weighted scatter plot using this package to describe properties of real-valued
    fuzzy data set.
