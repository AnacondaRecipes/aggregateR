  summary: 'Provides tools for an automated identification of diagnostic molecular characters,
    i.e. such columns in a given nucleotide or amino acid alignment that allow to distinguish
    taxa from each other. These characters can then be used to complement the formal
    descriptions of the taxa, which are often based on morphological and anatomical
    features. Especially for morphologically cryptic species, this will be helpful.
    QUIDDICH distinguishes between four different types of diagnostic characters. For
    more information, see "Kuehn, A.L., Haase, M. 2019. QUIDDICH: QUick IDentification
    of DIagnostic CHaracters."'
