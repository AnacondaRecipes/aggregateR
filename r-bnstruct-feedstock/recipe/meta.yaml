  summary: Bayesian Network Structure Learning from Data with Missing Values. The package implements
    the Silander-Myllymaki complete search, the Max-Min Parents-and-Children, the Hill-Climbing,
    the Max-Min Hill-climbing heuristic searches, and the Structural Expectation-Maximization
    algorithm. Available scoring functions are BDeu, AIC, BIC. The package also implements
    methods for generating and using bootstrap samples, imputed data, inference.
