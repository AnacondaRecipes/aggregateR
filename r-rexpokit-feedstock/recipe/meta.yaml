  summary: 'Wraps some of the matrix exponentiation  utilities from EXPOKIT (<http://www.maths.uq.edu.au/expokit/>),  a
    FORTRAN library that is widely recommended for matrix  exponentiation (Sidje RB,
    1998. "Expokit: A Software Package for Computing Matrix Exponentials." ACM Trans.
    Math. Softw. 24(1): 130-156).  EXPOKIT includes functions for  exponentiating both
    small, dense matrices, and large, sparse matrices (in sparse matrices, most of the
    cells have value 0). Rapid matrix exponentiation is useful in phylogenetics when
    we  have a large number of states (as we do when we are inferring  the history of
    transitions between the possible geographic  ranges of a species), but is probably
    useful in other ways as  well.'
