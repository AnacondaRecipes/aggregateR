  summary: Estimation and inference from generalized linear models based on various methods for
    bias reduction and maximum penalized likelihood with powers of the Jeffreys prior
    as penalty. The 'brglmFit' fitting method can achieve reduction of estimation bias
    by solving either the mean bias-reducing adjusted score equations in Firth (1993)
    <doi:10.1093/biomet/80.1.27> and Kosmidis and Firth (2009) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asp055>,
    or the median bias-reduction adjusted score equations in Kenne et al. (2017) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asx046>,
    or through the direct subtraction of an estimate of the bias of the maximum likelihood
    estimator from the maximum likelihood estimates as in Cordeiro and McCullagh (1991)
    <https://www.jstor.org/stable/2345592>. See Kosmidis et al (2020) <doi:10.1007/s11222-019-09860-6>
    for more details. Estimation in all cases takes place via a quasi Fisher scoring
    algorithm, and S3 methods for the construction of of confidence intervals for the
    reduced-bias estimates are provided. In the special case of generalized linear models
    for binomial and multinomial responses (both ordinal and nominal), the adjusted
    score approaches to mean and media bias reduction have been found to return estimates
    with improved frequentist properties, that are also always finite, even in cases
    where the maximum likelihood estimates are infinite (e.g. complete and quasi-complete
    separation; see Kosmidis and Firth, 2020 <doi:10.1093/biomet/asaa052>, for a proof
    for mean bias reduction in logistic regression).
