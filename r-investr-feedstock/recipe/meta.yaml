  summary: Functions to facilitate inverse estimation (e.g., calibration) in linear, generalized
    linear, nonlinear, and (linear) mixed-effects models. A generic function is also
    provided for plotting fitted regression models with or without confidence/prediction
    bands that may be of use to the general user. For a general overview of these methods,
    see Greenwell and Schubert Kabban (2014) <doi:10.32614/RJ-2014-009>.
