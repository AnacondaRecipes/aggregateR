  summary: 'Ing and Lai (2011) <doi:10.5705/ss.2010.081> proposed a high-dimensional model selection
    procedure that comprises three steps: orthogonal greedy algorithm (OGA), high-dimensional
    information criterion (HDIC), and Trim. The first two steps, OGA and HDIC, are used
    to sequentially select input variables and determine stopping rules, respectively.
    The third step, Trim, is used to delete irrelevant variables remaining in the second
    step. This package aims at fitting a high-dimensional linear regression model via
    OGA+HDIC+Trim.'
