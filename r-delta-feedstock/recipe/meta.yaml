  summary: "Measure of agreement delta was originally by Mart\xEDn & Femia (2004) <DOI:10.1348/000711004849268>.
    Since then has been considered as agreement measure for different fields, since
    their behavior is usually better than the usual kappa index by Cohen (1960) <DOI:10.1177/001316446002000104>.
    The main issue with delta is that can not be computed by hand contrary to kappa.
    The current algorithm is based on the Version 5 of the delta windows program that
    can be found on <https://www.ugr.es/~bioest/software/delta/cmd.php?seccion=downloads>."
