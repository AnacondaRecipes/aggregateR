  summary: Bayesian sample size calculation software and examples for EuroSARC clinical trials
    which utilise Bayesian methodology. These trials rely on binomial based endpoints
    so the majority of programs found here relate to this sort of endpoint. Developed
    as part of the EuroSARC FP7 grant.
