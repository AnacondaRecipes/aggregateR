  summary: Provides utility functions that are simply, frequently used, but may require higher
    performance that what can be obtained from base R. Incidentally provides support
    for 'reverse geocoding', such as matching a point with its nearest neighbour in
    another array. Used as a complement to package 'hutils' by sacrificing compilation
    or installation time for higher running speeds. The name is a portmanteau of the
    author and 'Rcpp'.
