  license: EUPL
  summary: Currently, the package provides four functions for plotting and analyzing bibliometric
    data (JIF, Journal Impact Factor, and paper percentile values), beamplots with citations,
    and two plot function to visualize the result of a reference publication year spectroscopy
    (RPYS) analysis performed in the free software 'CRExplorer' (see <http://crexplorer.net>).
    Further extension to more plot variants is planned.
