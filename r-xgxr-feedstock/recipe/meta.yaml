  summary: Supports a structured approach for exploring PKPD data <https://opensource.nibr.com/xgx/>.
    It also contains helper functions for enabling the modeler to follow best R practices
    (by appending the program name, figure name location, and draft status to each plot).
    In addition, it enables the modeler to follow best graphical practices (by providing
    a theme that reduces chart ink, and by providing time-scale, log-scale, and reverse-log-transform-scale
    functions for more readable axes). Finally, it provides some data checking and summarizing
    functions for rapidly exploring pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PKPD) datasets.
