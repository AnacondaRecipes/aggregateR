  summary: Most ROC curve plots obscure the cutoff values and inhibit interpretation and comparison
    of multiple curves. This attempts to address those shortcomings by providing plotting
    and interactive tools. Functions are provided to generate an interactive ROC curve
    plot for web use, and print versions. A Shiny application implementing the functions
    is also included.
