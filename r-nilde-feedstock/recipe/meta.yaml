  summary: Routines for enumerating all existing nonnegative integer solutions of a linear Diophantine
    equation. The package provides routines for solving 0-1, bounded and unbounded knapsack
    problems; 0-1, bounded and unbounded subset sum problems; additive partitioning
    of natural numbers; and one-dimensional bin-packing problem.
