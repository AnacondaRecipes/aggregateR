  summary: Given a high-dimensional dataset that typically represents a cytometry dataset, and
    a subset of the datapoints, this algorithm outputs an hyperrectangle so that datapoints
    within the hyperrectangle best correspond to the specified subset. In essence, this
    allows the conversion of clustering algorithms' outputs to gating strategies outputs.
