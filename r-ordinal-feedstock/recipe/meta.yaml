  summary: Implementation of cumulative link (mixed) models also known as ordered regression
    models, proportional odds models, proportional hazards models for grouped survival
    times and ordered logit/probit/... models. Estimation is via maximum likelihood
    and mixed models are fitted with the Laplace approximation and adaptive Gauss-Hermite
    quadrature. Multiple random effect terms are allowed and they may be nested, crossed
    or partially nested/crossed. Restrictions of symmetry and equidistance can be imposed
    on the thresholds (cut-points/intercepts). Standard model methods are available
    (summary, anova, drop-methods, step, confint, predict etc.) in addition to profile
    methods and slice methods for visualizing the likelihood function and checking convergence.
