  summary: Matrix eQTL is designed for fast eQTL analysis on large datasets. Matrix eQTL can
    test for association between genotype and gene expression using linear regression
    with either additive or ANOVA genotype effects. The models can include covariates
    to account for factors as population stratification, gender, and clinical variables.
    It also supports models with heteroscedastic and/or correlated errors, false discovery
    rate estimation and separate treatment of local (cis) and distant (trans) eQTLs.
