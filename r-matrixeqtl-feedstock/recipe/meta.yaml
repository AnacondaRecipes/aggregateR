  summary: Matrix eQTL is designed for fast eQTL analysis on large datasets. Matrix eQTL can
    test for association between genotype  and gene expression using linear regression  with
    either additive or ANOVA genotype effects. The models can include covariates to
    account for factors  as population stratification, gender, and clinical variables.  It
    also supports models with heteroscedastic and/or correlated errors, false discovery
    rate estimation and  separate treatment of local (cis) and distant (trans) eQTLs.
