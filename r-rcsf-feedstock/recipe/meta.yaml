  summary: Cloth Simulation Filter (CSF) is an airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) ground
    points filtering algorithm  which is based on cloth simulation. It tries to simulate
    the interactions between the cloth nodes and the corresponding LiDAR points, the
    locations of the cloth nodes can be determined to generate an approximation of the
    ground surface <https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/8/6/501/htm>.
