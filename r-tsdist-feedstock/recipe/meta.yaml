  summary: A set of commonly used distance measures and some additional functions which, although
    initially not designed for this purpose, can be used to measure the dissimilarity
    between time series. These measures can be used to perform clustering, classification
    or other data mining tasks which require the definition of a distance measure between
    time series. U. Mori, A. Mendiburu and J.A. Lozano (2016), <doi:10.32614/RJ-2016-058>.
