  summary: Clears the workspace. Useful for the beginnings of R scripts, to avoid potential problems
    with accidentally using information from variables or functions from previous script
    evaluations, too many figure windows open at the same time, packages that you don't
    need any more, or a cluttered console.  Uses code from various StackOverflow users.  See
    help(mise) for pointers to the relevant StackOverflow pages.
