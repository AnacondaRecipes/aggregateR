  summary: 'Estimation and regularization for covariance matrix of asset returns. For covariance
    matrix estimation, three major types of factor models are included: macroeconomic
    factor model, fundamental factor model and statistical factor model. For covariance
    matrix regularization, four regularized estimators are included: banding, tapering,
    hard-thresholding and soft- thresholding. The tuning parameters of these regularized
    estimators are selected via cross-validation.'
