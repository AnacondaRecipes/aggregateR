  summary: Recent gcc and clang compiler versions provide functionality to test for memory violations
    and other undefined behaviour; this is often referred to as "Address Sanitizer"
    (or 'ASAN') and "Undefined Behaviour Sanitizer" ('UBSAN'). The Writing R Extension
    manual describes this in some detail in Section 4.3 title "Checking Memory Access".
    . This feature has to be enabled in the corresponding binary, eg in R, which is
    somewhat involved as it also required a current compiler toolchain which is not
    yet widely available, or in the case of Windows, not available at all (via the common
    Rtools mechanism). . As an alternative, pre-built Docker containers such as the
    Rocker container 'r-devel-san' or the multi-purpose container 'r-debug' can be used.
    . This package then provides a means of testing the compiler setup as the known
    code failures provides in the sample code here should be detected correctly, whereas
    a default build of R will let the package pass. . The code samples are based on
    the examples from the Address Sanitizer Wiki at <https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki>.
