  summary: Adjusted odds ratio conditional on potential confounders can be directly obtained
    from logistic regression. However, those adjusted odds ratios have been widely incorrectly
    interpreted as a relative risk. As relative risk is often of interest in public
    health, we provide a simple code to return adjusted relative risks from logistic
    regression model under potential confounders.
