  summary: In many studies across different disciplines, detailed measures of the variables of
    interest are available. If assumptions can be made regarding the direction of effects
    between the assessed variables, this has to be considered in the analysis. The functions
    in this package implement the novel approach CIEE (causal inference using estimating
    equations; Konigorski et al., 2018, <DOI:10.1002/gepi.22107>) for estimating and
    testing the direct effect of an exposure variable on a primary outcome, while adjusting
    for indirect effects of the exposure on the primary outcome through a secondary
    intermediate outcome and potential factors influencing the secondary outcome. The
    underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG) of this considered model is described in
    the vignette. CIEE can be applied to studies in many different fields, and it is
    implemented here for the analysis of a continuous primary outcome and a time-to-event
    primary outcome subject to censoring. CIEE uses estimating equations to obtain estimates
    of the direct effect and robust sandwich standard error estimates. Then, a large-sample
    Wald-type test statistic is computed for testing the absence of the direct effect.
    Additionally, standard multiple regression, regression of residuals, and the structural
    equation modeling approach are implemented for comparison.
