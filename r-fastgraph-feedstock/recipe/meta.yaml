  summary: Provides functionality to produce graphs of probability density functions and cumulative
    distribution functions with few keystrokes, allows shading under the curve of the
    probability density function to illustrate concepts such as p-values and critical
    values, and fits a simple linear regression line on a scatter plot with the equation
    as the main title.
