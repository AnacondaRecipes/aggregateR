  summary: 'Interlinearized glossed texts (IGT) are used in descriptive linguistics for representing
    a morphological analysis of a text through a morpheme-by-morpheme gloss. ''InterlineaR''
    provide a set of functions that targets several popular formats of IGT (''SIL Toolbox'',
    ''EMELD XML'') and that turns an IGT into a set of data frames following a relational
    model (the tables represent the different linguistic units: texts, sentences, word,
    morphems). The same pieces of software (''SIL FLEX'', ''SIL Toolbox'') typically
    produce dictionaries of the morphemes used in the glosses. ''InterlineaR'' provide
    a function for turning the LIFT XML dictionary format into a set of data frames
    following a relational model in order to represent the dictionary entries, the sense(s)
    attached to the entries, the example(s) attached to senses, etc.'
