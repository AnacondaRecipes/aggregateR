  summary: The plsdof package provides Degrees of Freedom estimates for Partial Least Squares
    (PLS) Regression. Model selection for PLS is based on various information criteria
    (aic, bic, gmdl) or on cross-validation. Estimates for the mean and covariance of
    the PLS regression coefficients are available. They allow the construction of approximate
    confidence intervals and the application of test procedures (Kramer and Sugiyama
    2012 <doi:10.1198/jasa.2011.tm10107>). Further, cross-validation procedures for
    Ridge Regression and Principal Components Regression are available.
