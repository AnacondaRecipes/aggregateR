  summary: The plsdof package provides Degrees of Freedom estimates for Partial Least Squares
    (PLS) Regression. Model selection for PLS is based on various information criteria
    (aic, bic, gmdl) or on cross-validation. Estimates for the mean and covariance of
    the PLS regression coefficients are available. They allow the construction of approximate
    confidence intervals and the application of test procedures. Further, cross-validation
    procedures for Ridge Regression and Principal Components Regression are available.
