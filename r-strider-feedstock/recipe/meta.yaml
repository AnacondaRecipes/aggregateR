  summary: The strided iterator adapts multidimensional buffers to work with the C++ standard
    library and range-based for-loops. Given a pointer or iterator into a multidimensional
    data buffer, one can generate an iterator range using make_strided to construct
    strided versions of the standard library's begin and end. For constructing range-based
    for-loops, a strided_range class is provided. These help authors to avoid integer-based
    indexing, which in some cases can impede algorithm performance and introduce indexing
    errors. This library exists primarily to expose the header file to other R projects.
