  summary: Multi-stage selection is practiced in numerous fields of life and social sciences
    and particularly in breeding. A special characteristic of multi-stage selection
    is that candidates are evaluated in successive stages with increasing intensity
    and effort, and only a fraction of the superior candidates is selected and promoted
    to the next stage. For the optimum design of such selection programs, the selection
    gain plays a crucial role. It can be calculated by integration of a truncated multivariate
    normal (MVN) distribution. While mathematical formulas for calculating the selection
    gain and the variance among selected candidates were developed long time ago, solutions
    for numerical calculation were not available. This package can also be used for
    optimizing multi-stage selection programs for a given total budget and different
    costs of evaluating the candidates in each stage.
