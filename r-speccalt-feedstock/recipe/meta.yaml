  summary: Alternative to the kernlab::specc function. Includes a spectral clustering implementation,
    a locally adapted kernel function akin to what is already proposed in kernlab, and
    an optional procedure that automatically estimates the optimal number of clusters.
    Several sample data sets are also included.
