  summary: Collection of plotting and table output functions for data visualization. Results
    of various statistical analyses (that are commonly used in social sciences) can
    be visualized using this package, including simple and cross tabulated frequencies,
    histograms, box plots, (generalized) linear models, mixed effects models, principal
    component analysis and correlation matrices, cluster analyses, scatter plots, stacked
    scales, effects plots of regression models (including interaction terms) and much
    more. This package supports labelled data.
