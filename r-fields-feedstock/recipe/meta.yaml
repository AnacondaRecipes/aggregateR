  summary: For curve, surface and function fitting with an emphasis on splines, spatial data,
    geostatistics,  and spatial statistics. The major methods include cubic, and thin
    plate splines, Kriging, and compactly supported covariance functions for large data
    sets. The splines and Kriging methods are supported by functions that can determine
    the smoothing parameter (nugget and sill variance) and other covariance function
    parameters by cross validation and also by restricted maximum likelihood. For Kriging
    there is an easy to use function that also estimates the correlation scale (range
    parameter).  A major feature is that any covariance function implemented in R and
    following a simple format can be used for spatial prediction. There are also many
    useful functions for plotting and working with spatial data as images. This package
    also contains an implementation of sparse matrix methods for large spatial data
    sets and currently requires the sparse matrix (spam) package. Use help(fields) to
    get started and for an overview.  The fields source code is deliberately commented
    and provides useful explanations of numerical details as a companion to the manual
    pages. The commented source code can be viewed by expanding the source code version
    and looking in the R subdirectory. The reference for fields can be generated by
    the citation function in R and has DOI <doi:10.5065/D6W957CT>. Development of this
    package was supported in part by the National Science Foundation  Grant 1417857,  the
    National Center for Atmospheric Research, and Colorado School of Mines. See the
    Fields URL for a vignette on using this package and some background on spatial statistics.
