  summary: A latent, quasi-independent truncation time is assumed to be linked with the observed
    dependent truncation time, the event time, and an unknown transformation parameter
    via a structural transformation model. The transformation parameter is chosen to
    minimize the conditional Kendall's tau (Martin and Betensky, 2005) <doi:10.1198/016214504000001538>
    or the regression coefficient estimates (Jones and Crowley, 1992) <doi:10.2307/2336782>.
    The marginal distribution for the truncation time and the event time are completely
    left unspecified. The methodology is applied to survival curve estimation and regression
    analysis.
