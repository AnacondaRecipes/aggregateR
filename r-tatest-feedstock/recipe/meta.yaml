  summary: The ta-test is a modified two-sample or two-group t-test of Gosset (1908). In small
    samples with less than 15 replicates,the ta-test significantly reduces type I error
    rate but has almost the same power with the t-test and hence can greatly enhance
    reliability or reproducibility of discoveries in biology and medicine. The ta-test
    can test single null hypothesis or multiple null hypotheses without needing to correct
    p-values.
