  summary: 'An algorithm for identifying candidate driver combinations in cancer. CRSO  is based
    on a theoretical model of cancer in which a cancer rule  is defined to be a collection
    of two or more events (i.e., alterations) that are minimally  sufficient to cause
    cancer. A cancer rule set is a set of cancer rules that collectively  are assumed
    to account for all of ways to cause cancer in the population. In CRSO every  event
    is designated explicitly as a passenger or driver within each patient.  Each event
    is associated with a patient-specific, event-specific passenger penalty,  reflecting
    how unlikely the event would have happened by chance, i.e., as a passenger. CRSO
    evaluates each rule set by assigning all samples to a rule in the rule set, or to
    the null rule, and then calculating the total statistical penalty from all unassigned
    event. CRSO uses a three phase procedure find the best rule set of  fixed size K
    for a range of Ks. A core rule set is then identified from among the best rule sets
    of size K as the rule set that best balances rule set size and  statistical penalty.  Users
    should consult the ''crso'' vignette for an example walk through of a full CRSO
    run. The full description, of the CRSO algorithm is presented in:  Klein MI, Cannataro
    V, Townsend J, Stern DF and Zhao H. "Identifying combinations of cancer driver in
    individual patients."  BioRxiv 674234 [Preprint]. June 19, 2019. <doi:10.1101/674234>.
