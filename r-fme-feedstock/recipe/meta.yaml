  summary: Provides functions to help in fitting models to data, to perform Monte Carlo, sensitivity
    and identifiability analysis. It is intended to work with models be written as a
    set of differential equations that are solved either by an integration routine from
    package 'deSolve', or a steady-state solver from package 'rootSolve'. However, the
    methods can also be used with other types of functions.
