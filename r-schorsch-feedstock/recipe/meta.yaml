  summary: 'Offers a helping hand to psychologists and other behavioral scientists who routinely
    deal with experimental data from factorial experiments. It includes several functions
    to format output from other R functions according to the style guidelines of the
    APA (American Psychological Association). This formatted output can be copied directly
    into manuscripts to facilitate data reporting. These features are backed up by a
    toolkit of several small helper functions, e.g., offering out-of-the-box outlier
    removal. The package lends its name to Georg "Schorsch" Schuessler, ingenious technician
    at the Department of Psychology III, University of Wuerzburg. For details on the
    implemented methods, see Roland Pfister and Markus Janczyk (2016) <doi: 10.20982/tqmp.12.2.p147>.'
