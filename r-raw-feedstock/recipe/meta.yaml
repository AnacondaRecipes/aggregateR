  summary: In order to facilitate R instruction for actuaries, we have organized several  sets
    of publicly available data of interest to non-life actuaries. In addition, we suggest  a
    set of packages, which most practicing actuaries will use routinely. Finally, there
    is  an R markdown skeleton for basic reserve analysis.
