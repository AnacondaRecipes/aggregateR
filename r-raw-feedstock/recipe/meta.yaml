  summary: In order to facilitate R instruction for actuaries, we have organized several sets
    of publicly available data of interest to non-life actuaries. In addition, we suggest
    a set of packages, which most practicing actuaries will use routinely. Finally,
    there is an R markdown skeleton for basic reserve analysis.
