  summary: Calculates the nonparametric adaptive MAMSE weights for univariate, right-censored
    or multivariate data. The MAMSE weights can be used in a weighted likelihood or
    to define a mixture of empirical distribution functions. The package includes functions
    for the MAMSE weighted Kaplan-Meier estimate and for MAMSE weighted ROC curves.
