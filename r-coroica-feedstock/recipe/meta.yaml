  summary: Contains an implementation of a confounding robust independent component analysis
    (ICA) for noisy and grouped data. The main function coroICA() performs a blind source
    separation, by maximizing an independence across sources and allows to adjust for
    varying confounding based on user-specified groups. Additionally, the package contains
    the function uwedge() which can be used to approximately jointly diagonalize a list
    of matrices. For more details see the project website <https://sweichwald.de/coroICA/>.
