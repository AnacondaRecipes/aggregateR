  summary: Tired of copy and pasting almost identical markdown for badges in every new R-package
    that you create, on Github or other code-sharing sites?  This package allows you
    to easily paste badges. If you want to, it will also search  your DESCRIPTION file
    and extract the package name, license, R-version, and current projectversion and
    transform that into  badges. It will also search for a ".travis.yml" file and create
    a "Travis"" badge, if you use "Codecov.io" to check your code coverage after a "Travis"
    build  this package will also build a "Codecov.io"-badge. All the badges can be
    placed individually or can be placed below the top "YAML"" content of your "RMarkdown  file"
    (Readme.Rmd) or "README.md" file.  Currently creates badges for  Projectstatus ("Repostatus.org"),
    license Travis Build Status, Codecov, Minimal R version, CRAN status, CRAN downloads,  Github
    stars and forks, Package rank, rdocumentation,  current version of your package
    and last change of "README.Rmd".
