  summary: Provides analytic derivatives and information matrices for fitted linear mixed effects
    (lme) models and generalized least squares (gls) models estimated using lme() (from
    package 'nlme') and gls() (from package 'nlme'), respectively. The package includes
    functions for estimating the sampling variance-covariance of variance component
    parameters using the inverse Fisher information. The variance components include
    the parameters of the random effects structure (for lme models), the variance structure,
    and the correlation structure. The expected and average forms of the Fisher information
    matrix are used in the calculations, and models estimated by full maximum likelihood
    or restricted maximum likelihood are supported. The package also includes a function
    for estimating standardized mean difference effect sizes (Pustejovsky, Hedges, and
    Shadish (2014) <DOI:10.3102/1076998614547577>) based on fitted lme or gls models.
