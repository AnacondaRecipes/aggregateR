  summary: Functions for conducting robust variance estimation (RVE) meta-regression using both
    large and small sample RVE estimators under various weighting schemes. These methods
    are distribution free and provide valid point estimates, standard errors and hypothesis
    tests even when the degree and structure of dependence between effect sizes is unknown.
    Also included are functions for conducting sensitivity analyses under correlated
    effects weighting and producing RVE-based forest plots.
