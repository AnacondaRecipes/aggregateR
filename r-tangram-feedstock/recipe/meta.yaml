  summary: Provides an extensible formula system to quickly and easily create production quality
    tables. The steps of the process are formula parser, statistical content generation
    from data, to rendering. Each step of the process is separate and user definable
    thus creating a set of building blocks for highly extensible table generation. A
    user is not limited by any of the choices of the package creator other than the
    formula grammar. For example, one could chose to add a different S3 rendering function
    and output a format not provided in the default package. Or possibly one would rather
    have Gini coefficients for their statistical content. Routines to achieve New England
    Journal of Medicine style, Lancet style and Hmisc::summaryM() statistics are provided.
    The package contains rendering for HTML5, Rmarkdown and an indexing format for use
    in tracing and tracking are provided.
