  summary: Computes A-, MV-, D- and E-optimal or near-optimal row-column designs for two-colour
    cDNA microarray experiments using the linear fixed effects and mixed effects models
    where the interest is in a comparison of all pairwise treatment contrasts. The algorithms
    used in this package are based on the array exchange and treatment exchange algorithms
    adopted from Debusho, Gemechu and Haines (2016, unpublished) algorithms after adjusting
    for the row-column designs setup. The package also provides an optional method of
    using the graphical user interface (GUI) R package tcltk to ensure that it is user
    friendly.
