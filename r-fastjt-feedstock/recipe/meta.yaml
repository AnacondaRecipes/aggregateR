  summary: 'This ''Rcpp''-based package implements highly efficient functions for the calculation
    of the Jonckheere-Terpstra statistic. It can be used for a variety of applications,
    including feature selection in machine learning problems, or to conduct genome-wide
    association studies (GWAS) with multiple quantitative phenotypes. The code leverages
    ''OpenMP'' directives for multi-core computing to reduce overall processing time. '
