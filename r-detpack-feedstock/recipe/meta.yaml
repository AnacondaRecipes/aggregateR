  summary: 'Density estimation for possibly large data sets and conditional/unconditional random
    number generation or bootstrapping with distribution element trees. The function
    ''det.construct'' translates a dataset into a distribution element tree. To evaluate
    the probability density based on a previously computed tree at arbitrary query points,
    the function ''det.query'' is available. The functions ''det1'' and ''det2'' provide
    density estimation and plotting for one- and two-dimensional datasets. Conditional/unconditional
    smooth bootstrapping from an available distribution element tree can be performed
    by ''det.rnd''. For more details on distribution element trees, see: Meyer, D.W.
