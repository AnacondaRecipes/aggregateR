  summary: To determine the number of quantitative assays needed for a sample  of data using
    pooled testing methods, which include mini-pooling (MP), MP  with algorithm (MPA),
    and marker-assisted MPA (mMPA). To estimate the number  of assays needed, the package
    also provides a tool to conduct Monte Carlo (MC)  to simulate different orders in
    which the sample would be collected to form pools.  Using MC avoids the dependence
    of the estimated number of assays on any specific  ordering of the samples to form
    pools.
