  summary: 'Implements the orthogonal reparameterization approach recommended by Lancaster (2002)
    to estimate dynamic panel models with fixed effects (and optionally: panel specific
    intercepts). The approach uses a likelihood-based estimator and produces estimates
    that are asymptotically unbiased as N goes to infinity, with a T as low as 2.'
