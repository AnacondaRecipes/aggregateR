  summary: 'Implements a methodology for the design and analysis of dose-response studies that
    combines aspects of multiple comparison procedures  and modeling approaches (Bretz,
    Pinheiro and Branson, 2005, Biometrics 61, 738-748, <doi: 10.1111/j.1541-0420.2005.00344.x>).
    The package provides tools for the analysis of dose finding trials as well as a
    variety of tools necessary to plan a trial to be conducted with the MCP-Mod methodology.
    Please note: The ''MCPMod'' package will not be further developed, all future development
    of the MCP-Mod methodology will be done in the ''DoseFinding'' R-package.'
