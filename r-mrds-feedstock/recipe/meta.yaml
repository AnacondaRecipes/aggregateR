  summary: Animal abundance estimation via conventional, multiple covariate and mark-recapture
    distance sampling (CDS/MCDS/MRDS). Detection function fitting is performed via maximum
    likelihood. Also included are diagnostics and plotting for fitted detection functions.
    Abundance estimation is via a Horvitz-Thompson-like estimator.
