  summary: Data integration Web application for biobanks by 'OBiBa'. 'Opal' is the core database
    application for biobanks. Participant data, once collected from any data source,
    must be integrated and stored in a central data repository under a uniform model.
    'Opal' is such a central repository. It can import, process, validate, query, analyze,
    report, and export data. 'Opal' is typically used in a research center to analyze
    the data acquired at assessment centres. Its ultimate purpose is to achieve seamless
    data-sharing among biobanks. This 'Opal' client allows to interact with 'Opal' web
    services and to perform operations on the R server side. 'DataSHIELD' administration
    tools are also provided.
