  summary: The Prais-Winsten estimator (Prais & Winsten, 1954) takes into account AR(1) serial
    correlation of the errors in a linear regression model. The procedure recursively
    estimates the coefficients and the error autocorrelation of the specified model
    until sufficient convergence of the AR(1) coefficient is attained.
