  summary: An implementation of functions to optimize ordering of nodes in a dendrogram, without
    affecting the meaning of the dendrogram. A dendrogram can be sorted based on the
    average distance of subtrees, or based on the smallest distance value. These sorting
    methods improve readability and interpretability of tree structure, especially for
    tasks such as comparison of different distance measures or linkage types and identification
    of tight clusters and outliers. As a result, it also introduces more meaningful
    reordering for a coupled heatmap visualization.
