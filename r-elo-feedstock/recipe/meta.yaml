  summary: A flexible framework for calculating Elo ratings and resulting rankings of any two-team-per-matchup
    system (chess, sports leagues, 'Go', etc.). This implementation is capable of evaluating
    a variety of matchups, Elo rating updates, and win probabilities, all based on the
    basic Elo rating system. It also includes methods to benchmark performance, including
    logistic regression and Markov chain models.
