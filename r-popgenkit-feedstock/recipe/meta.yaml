  summary: There are two main purposes to this package. The first is to allow batch conversion
    of Genepop (Rousset 2008) input files for use with Arlequin (Excoffier and Lischer
    2010), which has a simple GUI to analyze batch files. Two commonly used simulation
    software, BottleSim (Kuo & Janzen 2003) and Easypop (Balloux 2001) produce Genepop
    output files that can be analyzed this way. There are also functions to convert
    to and from BottleSim format, to quickly produce allele frequency tables or to convert
    a file directly for use in ordination analyses (e.g. principal component analysis).
    This package also includes functions to calculate allele rarefaction curves, confidence
    intervals on heterozygosity and allelic richness with resampling strategies (bootstrap
    and jackknife).
