  summary: Provides an abstraction for managing, installing, and switching between sets of installed
    R packages. This allows users to maintain multiple package libraries simultaneously,
    e.g. to maintain strict, package-version-specific reproducibility of many analyses,
    or work within a development/production release paradigm. Introduces a generalized
    package installation process which supports multiple repository and non-repository
    sources and tracks package provenance.
