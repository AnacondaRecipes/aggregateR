  summary: In this package, we introduce an R function one_two_sample() which can deal with one
    and two (normal) samples. For one normal sample x, the function reports descriptive
    statistics, plot, interval estimation and test of hypothesis of x. For two normal
    samples x and y, the function reports descriptive statistics, plot, interval estimation
    and test of hypothesis of x and y, respectively. It also reports interval estimation
    and test of hypothesis of mu1-mu2 (the difference of the means of x and y) and sigma1^2
    / sigma2^2 (the ratio of the variances of x and y), tests whether x and y are from
    the same population, finds the correlation coefficient of x and y if x and y have
    the same length.
