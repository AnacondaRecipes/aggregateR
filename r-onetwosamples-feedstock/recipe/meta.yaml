  summary: We introduce an R function one_two_sample() which can deal with one and two (normal)
    samples, Ying-Ying Zhang, Yi Wei (2012) <doi:10.2991/asshm-13.2013.29>. For one
    normal sample x, the function reports descriptive statistics, plot, interval estimation
    and test of hypothesis of x. For two normal samples x and y, the function reports
    descriptive statistics, plot, interval estimation and test of hypothesis of x and
    y, respectively. It also reports interval estimation and test of hypothesis of mu1-mu2
    (the difference of the means of x and y) and sigma1^2 / sigma2^2 (the ratio of the
    variances of x and y), tests whether x and y are from the same population, finds
    the correlation coefficient of x and y if x and y have the same length.
