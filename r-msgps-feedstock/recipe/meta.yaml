  summary: Computes the degrees of freedom of the lasso, elastic net, generalized elastic net
    and adaptive lasso based on the generalized path seeking algorithm.  The optimal
    model can be selected by model selection criteria including Mallows' Cp, bias-corrected
    AIC (AICc), generalized cross validation (GCV) and BIC.
