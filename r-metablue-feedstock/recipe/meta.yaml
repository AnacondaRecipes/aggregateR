  summary: The sample mean and standard deviation are two commonly used statistics in meta-analyses,  but
    some trials use other summary statistics such as the median and quartiles to report
    the results.  Therefore, researchers need to transform those information back to
    the sample mean and  standard deviation. This package implemented sample mean estimators
    by Luo et al. (2016) <arXiv:1505.05687>, sample standard deviation estimators by
    Wan et al. (2014) <arXiv:1407.8038>, and the best linear unbiased estimators (BLUEs)
    of location and scale parameters by Yang et al. (2018, submitted) based on sample
    quantiles derived summaries in a meta-analysis.
