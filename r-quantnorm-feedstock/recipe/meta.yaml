  summary: Modifies the distance matrix obtained from data with batch effects, so as to improve
    the performance of sample pattern detection, such as clustering, dimension reduction,
    and construction of networks between subjects. The method has been published in
    Bioinformatics (Fei et al, 2018, <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty117>). Also available
