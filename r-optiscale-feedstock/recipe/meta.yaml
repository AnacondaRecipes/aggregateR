  summary: Optimal scaling of a data vector, relative to a set of targets, is obtained through
    a least-squares transformation subject to appropriate measurement constraints. The
    targets are usually predicted values from a statistical model. If the data are nominal
    level, then the transformation must be identity-preserving. If the data are ordinal
    level, then the transformation must be monotonic. If the data are discrete, then
    tied data values must remain tied in the optimal transformation. If the data are
    continuous, then tied data values can be untied in the optimal transformation.
