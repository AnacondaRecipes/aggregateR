  summary: Functions to organize data, methods, and results used in scientific analyses. A TAF
    analysis consists of four scripts (data.R, model.R, output.R, report.R) that are
    run sequentially. Each script starts by reading files from a previous step and ends
    with writing out files for the next step. Convenience functions are provided to
    version control the required data and software, run analyses, clean residues from
    previous runs, manage files, manipulate tables, and produce figures. With a focus
    on stability and reproducible analyses, TAF is designed to have no package dependencies.
    TAF forms a base layer for the 'icesTAF' package and other scientific applications.
