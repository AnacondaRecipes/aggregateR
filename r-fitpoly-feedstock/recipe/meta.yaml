  summary: 'Genotyping assays for bi-allelic markers (e.g. SNPs) produce signal intensities for
    the two alleles. ''fitPoly'' assigns genotypes (allele dosages) to a collection
    of polyploid samples based on these signal intensities. ''fitPoly'' replaces the
    older package ''fitTetra'' that was limited (a.o.) to only tetraploid populations
    whereas ''fitPoly'' accepts any ploidy level. Reference: Voorrips RE, Gort G, Vosman
