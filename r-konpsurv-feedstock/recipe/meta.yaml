  summary: The K-sample omnibus non-proportional hazards (KONP) tests are powerful non-parametric
    tests for comparing K (>=2) hazard functions based on right-censored data (Gorfine,
    Schlesinger and Hsu, 2020, <doi:10.1177/0962280220907355>). These tests are consistent
    against any differences between the hazard functions of the groups. The KONP tests
    are often more powerful than other existing tests, especially under non-proportional
    hazard functions.
