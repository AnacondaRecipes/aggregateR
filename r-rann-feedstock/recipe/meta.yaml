  summary: Finds the k nearest neighbours for every point in a given dataset in O(N log N) time
    using Arya and Mount's ANN library (v1.1.3). There is support for approximate as
    well as exact searches, fixed radius searches and 'bd' as well as 'kd' trees. The
    distance is computed using the L2 (Euclidean) metric. Please see package 'RANN.L1'
    for the same functionality using the L1 (Manhattan, taxicab) metric.
