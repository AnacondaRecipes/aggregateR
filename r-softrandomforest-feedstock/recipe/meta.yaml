  summary: 'Performs random forests for soft decision trees for a  classification problem.  Current
    limitations are for a maximum depth of 5 resulting in 16 terminal nodes.  Some data
    cleaning is required before input.  Final graphic output requires currently requires
    exporting to ''Microsoft Excel'' for visualization.  Method based on Irsoy, Yildiz
