  summary: Provides flexible hazard ratio curves allowing non-linear relationships between continuous
    predictors and survival. To better understand the effects that each continuous covariate
    has on the outcome, results are ex pressed in terms of hazard ratio curves, taking
    a specific covariate value as reference. Confidence bands for these curves are also
    derived.
