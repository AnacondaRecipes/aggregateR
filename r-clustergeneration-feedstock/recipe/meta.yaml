  summary: We developed the clusterGeneration package to provide functions for generating random
    clusters, generating random covariance/correlation matrices, calculating a separation
    index (data and population version) for pairs of clusters or cluster distributions,
    and 1-D and 2-D projection plots to visualize clusters.  The package also contains
    a function to generate random clusters based on factorial designs with factors such
    as degree of separation, number of clusters, number of variables, number of noisy
    variables.
