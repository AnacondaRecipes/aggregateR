  summary: Novel method to unbiasedly include studies with Non-statistically Significant Unreported
    Effects (NSUEs) in a meta-analysis. First, the method calculates the interval where
    the unreported effects (e.g., t-values) should be according to the threshold of
    statistical significance used in each study. Afterwards, the method uses maximum
    likelihood techniques to impute the expected effect size of each study with NSUEs,
    accounting for between-study heterogeneity and potential covariates. Multiple imputations
    of the NSUEs are then randomly created based on the expected value, variance, and
    statistical significance bounds. Finally, it conducts a restricted-maximum likelihood
    random-effects meta-analysis separately for each set of imputations and it conducts
    estimations from these meta-analyses. Please read the reference in 'metansue' for
    details of the procedure.
