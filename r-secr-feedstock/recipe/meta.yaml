  summary: Functions to estimate the density and size of a spatially distributed animal population
    sampled with an array of passive detectors, such as traps, or by searching polygons
    or transects. Models incorporating distance-dependent detection are fitted by maximizing
    the likelihood. Tools are included for data manipulation and model selection.
