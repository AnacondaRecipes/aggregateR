  summary: This package provides a set of tools for conducting exact or approximate randomization-based
    inference for experiments of arbitrary design. The primary functionality of the
    package is in the generation, manipulation and use of permutation matrices implied
    by given experimental designs. Among other features, the package facilitates estimation
    of average treatment effects, constant effects variance estimation, randomization
    inference for significance testing against sharp null hypotheses and visualization
    of data and results.
