  summary: "The goal is to print an \"aper\xC3\xA7u\", a short view of a vector, a matrix, a
    data.frame, a list or an array. By default, it prints the first 5 elements of each
    dimension. By default, the number of columns is equal to the number of lines. If
    you want to control the selection of the elements, you can pass a list, with each
    element being a vector giving the selection for each dimension."
