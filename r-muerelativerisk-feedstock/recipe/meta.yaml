  summary: Implements an estimator for relative risk based on the median unbiased estimator.
    The relative risk estimator is well defined and performs satisfactorily for a wide
    range of data configurations. The details of the method are available in Carter
    et al (2010) <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9876.2010.00711.x>.
