  summary: Package contains most of the popular internal and external cluster validation methods
    ready to use for the most of the outputs produced by functions coming from package
    "cluster". Package contains also functions and examples of usage for cluster stability
    approach that might be applied to algorithms implemented in "cluster" package as
    well as user defined clustering algorithms.
