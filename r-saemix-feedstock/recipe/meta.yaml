  summary: 'The SAEMIX package implements the Stochastic Approximation EM algorithm for parameter
    estimation in (non)linear mixed effects models. The SAEM algorithm: - computes the
    maximum likelihood estimator of the population parameters, without any approximation
    of the model (linearisation, quadrature approximation,...), using the Stochastic
    Approximation Expectation Maximization (SAEM) algorithm, - provides standard errors
    for the maximum likelihood estimator - estimates the conditional modes, the conditional
    means and the conditional standard deviations of the individual parameters, using
    the Hastings-Metropolis algorithm. Several applications of SAEM in agronomy, animal
    breeding and PKPD analysis have been published by members of the Monolix group (<http://group.monolix.org/>).'
