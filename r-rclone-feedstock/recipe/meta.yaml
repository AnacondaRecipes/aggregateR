  summary: R version of 'GenClone' (a computer program to analyse genotypic data, test for clonality
    and describe spatial clonal organization, Arnaud-Haond & Belkhir 2007, <http://wwz.ifremer.fr/clonix/content/download/68205/903914/file/GenClone2.0.setup.zip>),
    this package allows clone handling as 'GenClone' does, plus the possibility to work
    with several populations, MultiLocus Lineages (MLL) custom definition and use, and
    p-value calculation for psex statistic (probability of originating from distinct
    sexual events) and psex_Fis statistic (taking account of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
    departure) as 'MLGsim'/'MLGsim2' (a program for detecting clones using a simulation
    approach, Stenberg et al. 2003).
