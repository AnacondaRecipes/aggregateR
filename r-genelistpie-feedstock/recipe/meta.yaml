  summary: '"geneListPie" package is for mapping a gene list to function categories defined in
    GOSlim or Kegg. The results can be plotted as a pie chart to provide a quick view
    of the genes distribution of the gene list among the function categories. The gene
    list must contain a list of gene symbols. The package contains a set of pre-processed
    gene sets obtained from Gene Ontology and MSigDB including human, mouse, rat and
    yeast. To provide a high level concise view, only GO slim and kegg are provided.
    The gene sets are regulared updated. User can also use customized gene sets. User
    can use the R Pie() or Pie3D() function for plotting the pie chart. Users can also
    choose to output the gene function mapping results and use external software such
    as Excel(R) for ploting.'
