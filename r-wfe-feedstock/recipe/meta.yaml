  summary: Provides a computationally efficient way of fitting weighted linear fixed effects
    estimators for causal inference with various weighting schemes. Weighted linear
    fixed effects estimators can be used to estimate the average treatment effects under
    different identification strategies. This includes stratified randomized experiments,
    matching and stratification for observational studies, first differencing, and difference-in-differences.
    The package implements methods described in Imai and Kim (2017) "When should We
    Use Linear Fixed Effects Regression Models for Causal Inference with Longitudinal
    Data?", available at <https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/FEmatch.html>.
