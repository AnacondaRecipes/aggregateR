  summary: "Performs logistic regression for binary longitudinal data, allowing for serial dependence
    among observations from a given individual and a random intercept term. Estimation
    is via maximization of the exact likelihood of a suitably defined model. Missing
    values and unbalanced data are allowed, with some restrictions. M. Helena Gon\uFFFDalves
