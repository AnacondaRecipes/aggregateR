  summary: Core functionality for working with vectors (numeric, integer, logical and character)
    that are too large to keep in memory. The vectors are kept (partially) on disk using
    memory mapping. This package contains the basic functionality for working with these
    memory mapped vectors (e.g. creating, indexing, ordering and sorting) and provides
    C++ headers which can be used by other packages to extend the functionality provided
    in this package.
