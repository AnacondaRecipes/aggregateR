  summary: This subsample winner algorithm (SWA) for regression with a large-p data (X, Y) selects
    the important variables (or features) among the p features X in explaining the response
    Y.  The SWA first uses a base procedure,  here a linear regression, on each of subsamples
    randomly drawn from the p variables, and then computes the scores of all features,
    i.e., the p variables,  according to the performance of these features collected
    in each of the subsample analyses. It then obtains the 'semifinalist' of the features
    based on the resulting scores and determines the 'finalists', i.e., the important
    features, from the 'semifinalist'.  Fan, Sun and Qiao (2017) <http://sr2c.case.edu/swa-reg/>.
