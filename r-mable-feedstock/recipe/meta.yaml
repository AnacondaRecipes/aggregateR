  summary: 'Fit raw or grouped continuous data from a population with a smooth density on unit
    interval by an approximate Bernstein polynomial model which is a mixture of certain
    beta distributions and find maximum approximate Bernstein likelihood estimator of
    the unknown coefficients. Consequently, maximum likelihood estimates of the unknown
    density, distribution functions, and more can be obtained. If the support of the
    density is not the unit interval then transformation can be applied. This is an
