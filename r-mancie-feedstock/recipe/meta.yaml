  summary: High-dimensional data integration is a critical but difficult problem in genomics
    research because of potential biases from high-throughput experiments. We present
    MANCIE, a computational method for integrating two genomic data sets with homogenous
    dimensions from different sources based on a PCA procedure as an approximation to
    a Bayesian approach.
