  summary: A general framework for constructing variable importance plots from various types
    of machine learning models in R. Aside from some standard model- specific variable
    importance measures, this package also provides model- agnostic approaches that
    can be applied to any supervised learning algorithm. These include 1) an efficient
    permutation-based variable importance measure, 2) variable importance based on Shapley
    values (Strumbelj and Kononenko, 2014) <doi:10.1007/s10115-013-0679-x>, and 3) the
    variance-based approach described in Greenwell et al. (2018) <arXiv:1805.04755>.
    A variance-based method for quantifying the relative strength of interaction effects
    is also included (see the previous reference for details).
