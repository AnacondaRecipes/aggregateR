  summary: 'Empirical likelihood (EL) inference for two-sample problems. The following statistics
    are included: the difference of two-sample means, smooth Huber estimators, quantile
    (qdiff) and cumulative distribution functions (ddiff), probability-probability (P-P)
    and quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots as well as receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
    curves.'
