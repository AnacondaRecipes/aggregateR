  summary: 'Empirical likelihood (EL) inference for two-sample problems. The following statistics
    are included: the difference of two-sample means, smooth Huber estimators, quantile
    (qdiff) and cumulative distribution functions (ddiff), probability-probability (P-P)
    and quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots as well as receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
    curves. EL calculations are based on J. Valeinis, E. Cers (2011) <http://home.lu.lv/~valeinis/lv/petnieciba/EL_TwoSample_2011.pdf>.'
