  summary: Contains tools to fit both predictive and prognostic biomarker effects using biomarker
    threshold models. Evaluate the treatment effect, biomarker effect and treatment-biomarker
    interaction using probability index measurement. Test for treatment-biomarker interaction
    using residual bootstrap method.
