  summary: Calculates an acceptance sampling plan, (sample size and acceptance number) based
    in MIL STD 105E, Dodge  Romig and MIL STD 414 tables and procedures. The arguments
    for each function are related to lot size, inspection level and quality level. The
    specific plan operating curve (OC), is calculated by the binomial distribution.
