  summary: Automatic generation of exams based on exercises in Markdown or LaTeX format, possibly
    including R code for dynamic generation of exercise elements. Exercise types include
    single-choice and multiple-choice questions, arithmetic problems, string questions,
    and combinations thereof (cloze). Output formats include standalone files (PDF,
    HTML, Docx, ODT, ...), Moodle XML, QTI 1.2, QTI 2.1, Blackboard, Canvas, OpenOlat,
    ILIAS, TestVision, Particify, ARSnova, Kahoot!, Grasple, and TCExam. In addition
    to fully customizable PDF exams, a standardized PDF format (NOPS) is provided that
    can be printed, scanned, and automatically evaluated.
