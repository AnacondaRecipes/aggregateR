  summary: An implementation of the Abnormal Blood Profile Score (ABPS, part of the Athlete Biological
    Passport program of the World Anti-Doping Agency), which combines several blood
    parameters into a single score in order to detect blood doping (Sottas et al. (2006)
    <doi:10.2202/1557-4679.1011>). The package also contains functions to calculate
    other scores used in anti-doping programs, such as the OFF-score (Gore et al. (2003)
    <http://www.haematologica.org/content/88/3/333>), as well as example data.
