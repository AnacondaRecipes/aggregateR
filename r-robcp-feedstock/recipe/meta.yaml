  summary: Provides robust methods to detect change-points in uni- or multivariate time series.
    They can cope with corrupted data and heavy tails. One can detect changes in location,
    scale and dependence structure of a possibly multivariate time series. Procedures
    are based on Huberized versions of CUSUM tests proposed in Duerre and Fried (2019)
    <arXiv:1905.06201>.
