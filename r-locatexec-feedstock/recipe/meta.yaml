  summary: A set of functions to locate some programs available on the user machine. The package
    provides functions to locate 'Node.js', 'npm', 'LibreOffice', 'Microsoft Word',
    'Microsoft PowerPoint', 'Microsoft Excel', 'Python', 'pip', 'Mozilla Firefox' and
    'Google Chrome'. User can test the availability of a program with eventually a version
    and call it with function system2() or system(). This allows the use of a single
    function to retrieve the path to a program regardless of the operating system and
    its configuration.
