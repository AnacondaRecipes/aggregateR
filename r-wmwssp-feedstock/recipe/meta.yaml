  summary: 'Calculates the minimal sample size for the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test that is needed
    for a given power and two sided type I error rate. The method works for metric data
    with and without ties, count data, ordered categorical data, and even dichotomous
    data. But data is needed for the reference group to generate synthetic data for
    the treatment group based on a relevant effect. For details, see Brunner, E., Bathke
