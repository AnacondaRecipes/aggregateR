  summary: Functions to calculate fuzzy versions of species' occurrence patterns based on presence-absence
    data (including inverse distance interpolation, trend surface analysis and prevalence-independent
    favourability GLM), and pair-wise fuzzy similarity (based on fuzzy versions of commonly
    used similarity indices) among those occurrence patterns. Includes also functions
    for model comparison (overlap and fuzzy similarity, loss or gain), and for data
    preparation, such as obtaining unique abbreviations of species names, converting
    species lists (long format) to presence-absence tables (wide format), transposing
    part of a data frame, assessing the false discovery rate, or analysing and dealing
    with multicollinearity among variables. Includes also sample datasets for providing
    practical examples.
