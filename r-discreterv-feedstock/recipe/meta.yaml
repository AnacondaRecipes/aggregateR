  summary: Create, manipulate, transform, and simulate from discrete random variables. The syntax
    is modeled after that which is used in mathematical statistics and probability courses,
    but with powerful support for more advanced probability calculations. This includes
    the creation of joint random variables, and the derivation and manipulation of their
    conditional and marginal distributions.
