  summary: 'Clusters features under the assumption that each cluster has a random effect and
    there is an outcome variable that is related to the random  effects by a linear
    regression. In this way the cluster analysis is  ``supervised'''' by the outcome
    variable. An alternate specification is that  features in each cluster have the
    same compound symmetric normal distribution,  and the conditional distribution of
    the outcome given the features has the same coefficient for each feature in a cluster. '
