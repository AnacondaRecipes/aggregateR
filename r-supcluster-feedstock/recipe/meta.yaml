  summary: Clusters features under the assumption that each cluster has a random effect and there
    is an outcome variable that is related to the random effects by a linear regression.
    In this way the cluster analysis is ``supervised'' by the outcome variable. An alternate
    specification is that features in each cluster have the same compound symmetric
    normal distribution, and the conditional distribution of the outcome given the features
    has the same coefficient for each feature in a cluster.
