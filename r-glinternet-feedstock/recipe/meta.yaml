  summary: 'Group-Lasso INTERaction-NET. Fits linear pairwise-interaction models that satisfy
    strong hierarchy: if an interaction coefficient is estimated to be nonzero, then
    its two associated main effects also have nonzero estimated coefficients. Accommodates
    categorical variables (factors) with arbitrary numbers of levels, continuous variables,
    and combinations thereof. Implements the machinery described in the paper "Learning
    interactions via hierarchical group-lasso regularization" (JCGS 2015, Volume 24,
    Issue 3). Michael Lim & Trevor Hastie (2015) <DOI:10.1080/10618600.2014.938812>.'
