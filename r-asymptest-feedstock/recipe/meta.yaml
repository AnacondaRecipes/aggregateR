  summary: One and two sample mean and variance tests (differences and ratios) are considered.
    The test statistics are all expressed in the same form as the Student t-test, which
    facilitates their presentation in the classroom. This contribution also fills the
    gap of a robust (to non-normality) alternative to the chi-square single variance
    test for large samples, since no such procedure is implemented in standard statistical
    software.
