  summary: Provides tools for joint analysis of multiple traits in a backcross (BC) or recombinant
    inbred lines (RIL) population. It can be used to select an optimal subset of traits
    for multiple-trait mapping, analyze multiple traits via the SURE model, which can
    associate different QTL with different traits, and perform multiple-trait composite
    multiple-interval mapping.
