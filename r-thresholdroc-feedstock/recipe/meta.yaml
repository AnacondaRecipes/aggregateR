  summary: Functions that provide point and interval estimations of optimum thresholds for continuous
    diagnostic tests. The methodology used is based on minimizing an overall cost function
    in the two- and three-state settings. The package also provides functions for sample
    size determination and estimation of diagnostic accuracy measures. It also includes
    graphical tools.
