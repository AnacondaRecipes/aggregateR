  summary: Functions that provide point and interval estimations of optimum thresholds for continuous
    diagnostic tests. The methodology used is based on minimizing an overall cost function
    in the two- and three-state settings. We also provide functions for sample size
    determination and estimation of diagnostic accuracy measures. We also include graphical
    tools. The statistical methodology used here can be found in Perez-Jaume et al (2017)
