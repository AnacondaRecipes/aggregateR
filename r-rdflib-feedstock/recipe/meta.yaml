  summary: The Resource Description Framework, or 'RDF' is a widely used data representation
    model that forms the cornerstone of the Semantic Web. 'RDF' represents data as a
    graph rather than the familiar data table or rectangle of relational databases.
    The 'rdflib' package provides a friendly and concise user interface for performing
    common tasks on 'RDF' data, such as reading, writing and converting between the
    various serializations of 'RDF' data, including 'rdfxml', 'turtle', 'nquads', 'ntriples',
    and 'json-ld'; creating new 'RDF' graphs, and performing graph queries using 'SPARQL'.
    This package wraps the low level 'redland' R package which provides direct bindings
    to the 'redland' C library.  Additionally, the package supports the newer and more
    developer friendly 'JSON-LD' format through the 'jsonld' package. The package interface
    takes inspiration from the Python 'rdflib' library.
