  summary: Solves Teitz and Bart's p-median problem - given a set of points attempts to find
    subset of size p such that summed distances of any point in the set to the nearest
    point in p is minimised.  Although generally effective, this algorithm does not
    guarantee that a globally optimal subset is found.
