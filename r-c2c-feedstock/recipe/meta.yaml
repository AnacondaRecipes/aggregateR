  summary: Compare two classifications or clustering solutions that may or may not have the same
    number of classes, and that might have hard or soft (fuzzy, probabilistic) membership.
    Calculate various metrics to assess how the clusters compare to each other. The
    calculations are simple, but provide a handy tool for users unfamiliar with matrix
    multiplication. This package is not geared towards traditional accuracy assessment
    for classification/ mapping applications - the motivating use case is for comparing
    a probabilistic clustering solution to a set of reference or existing class labels
    that could have any number of classes (that is, without having to degrade the probabilistic
    clustering to hard classes).
