  summary: This is a set of tools for dendrograms and tree plots using 'ggplot2'.  The 'ggplot2'
    philosophy is to clearly separate data from the presentation. Unfortunately the
    plot method for dendrograms plots directly to a plot device without exposing the
    data. The 'ggdendro' package resolves this by making available functions that extract
    the dendrogram plot data. The package provides implementations for 'tree', 'rpart',
    as well as diana and agnes (from 'cluster') diagrams.
