  summary: Collection of functions dealing with labelled data, like reading and writing data
    between R and other statistical software packages like 'SPSS', 'SAS' or 'Stata',
    and working with labelled data. This includes easy ways to get, set or change value
    and variable label attributes, to convert labelled vectors into factors or numeric
    (and vice versa), or to deal with multiple declared missing values.
