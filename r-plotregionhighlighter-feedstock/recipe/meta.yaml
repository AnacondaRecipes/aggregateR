  summary: Creates an envelope around a set of plotted points. The envelope is compact with a
    boundary that is continuous, smooth and convex. Each point is represented as a circle
    and the circles and connecting lines are the solution to the multiple pulley problem.
    This method can be used to highlight regions in a two-dimensional space.
