  summary: Track and report code coverage for your package and (optionally) upload the results
    to a coverage service like 'Codecov' <https://codecov.io> or 'Coveralls' <https://coveralls.io>.
    Code coverage is a measure of the amount of code being exercised by a set of tests.
    It is an indirect measure of test quality and completeness. This package is compatible
    with any testing methodology or framework and tracks coverage of both R code and
    compiled C/C++/FORTRAN code.
