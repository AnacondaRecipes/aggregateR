  summary: Learned Pattern Similarity (LPS) for time series. Implements a novel approach to model
    the dependency structure in time series that generalizes the concept of autoregression
    to local auto-patterns. Generates a pattern-based representation of time series
    along with a similarity measure called Learned Pattern Similarity (LPS). Introduces
    a generalized autoregressive kernel.This package is based on the 'randomForest'
    package by Andy Liaw.
