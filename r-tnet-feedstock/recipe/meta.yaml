  summary: Binary ties limit the richness of network analyses as relations are unique. The two-mode
    structure contains a number of features lost when projection it to a one-mode network.
    Longitudinal datasets allow for an understanding of the causal relationship among
    ties, which is not the case in cross-sectional datasets as ties are dependent upon
    each other.
