  summary: Contains some tools for testing, analyzing time series data and fitting popular time
    series models such as ARIMA, Moving Average and Holt Winters, etc. Most functions
    also provide nice and clear outputs like SAS does, such as identify, estimate and
    forecast, which are the same statements in PROC ARIMA in SAS.
