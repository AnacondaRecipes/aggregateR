  summary: Temporal disaggregation methods are used to disaggregate and interpolate a low frequency
    time series to a higher frequency series, where either the sum, the mean, the first
    or the last value of the resulting high frequency series is consistent with the
    low frequency series. Temporal disaggregation can be performed with or without one
    or more high frequency indicator series. Contains the methods of Chow-Lin, Santos-Silva-Cardoso,
    Fernandez, Litterman, Denton and Denton-Cholette, summarized in Sax and Steiner
    (2013) <doi:10.32614/RJ-2013-028>. Supports most R time series classes.
