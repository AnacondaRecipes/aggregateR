  summary: Temporal disaggregation methods are used to disaggregate and interpolate a low frequency
    time series to a higher frequency series, where either the sum, the average, the
    first or the last value of the resulting high frequency series is consistent with
    the low frequency series. Temporal disaggregation can be performed with or without
    one or more high frequency indicator series. Contains the methods of Chow-Lin, Santos-Silva-Cardoso,  Fernandez,
    Litterman, Denton and Denton-Cholette.
