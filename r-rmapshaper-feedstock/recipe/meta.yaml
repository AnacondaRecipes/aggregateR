  summary: Edit and simplify 'geojson', 'Spatial', and 'sf' objects.  This is wrapper around
    the 'mapshaper' 'JavaScript' library by Matthew Bloch <https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper/>
    to perform topologically-aware polygon simplification, as well as other operations
    such as clipping, erasing, dissolving, and converting 'multi-part' to 'single-part'
    geometries.
