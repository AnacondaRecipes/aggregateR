  summary: "Multivariate optimal allocation for different domains in one and two stages stratified
    sample design. R2BEAT extends the Neyman (1934) \u2013 Tschuprow (1923) allocation
    method to the case of several variables, adopting a generalization of the Bethel\u2019s
    proposal (1989).R2BEAT develops this methodology but, moreover, it allows to determine
    the sample allocation in the multivariate and multi-domains case of estimates for
    two-stage stratified samples. It also allows to perform both Primary Stage Units
    and Secondary Stage Units selection. This package requires the availability of ReGenesees,
    that can be installed from <https://github.com/DiegoZardetto/ReGenesees>."
