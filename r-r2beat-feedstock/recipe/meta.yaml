  summary: "Multivariate optimal allocation for different domains in one and two stages stratified
    sample design. 'R2BEAT' extends the Neyman (1934) \u2013 Tschuprow (1923) allocation
    method to the case of several variables, adopting a generalization of the Bethel\u2019s
    proposal (1989). 'R2BEAT' develops this methodology but, moreover, it allows to
    determine the sample allocation in the multivariate and multi-domains case of estimates
    for two-stage stratified samples. It also allows to perform both Primary Stage Units
    and Secondary Stage Units selection. This package requires the availability of 'ReGenesees',
    that can be installed from <https://github.com/DiegoZardetto/ReGenesees>."
