  summary: "Multivariate optimal allocation for different domains in one and two stages stratified
    sample design. R2BEAT extends the Neyman (1934) <doi:10.2307/2342192> \u2013 Tschuprow
    (1923) allocation method to the case of several variables, adopting a generalization
    of the Bethel\u2019s proposal (1989). R2BEAT develops this methodology but, moreover,
    it allows to determine the sample allocation in the multivariate and multi-domains
    case of estimates for two-stage stratified samples. "
