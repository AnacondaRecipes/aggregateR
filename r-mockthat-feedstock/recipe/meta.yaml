  summary: With the deprecation of mocking capabilities shipped with 'testthat' as of 'edition
    3' it is left to third-party packages to replace this functionality, which in some
    test-scenarios is essential in order to run unit tests in limited environments (such
    as no Internet connection). Mocking in this setting means temporarily substituting
    a function with a stub that acts in some sense like the original function (for example
    by serving a HTTP response that has been cached as a file). The only exported function
    'with_mock()' is modeled after the eponymous 'testthat' function with the intention
    of providing a drop-in replacement.
