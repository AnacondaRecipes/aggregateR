  summary: This package is based on the C++ code from Yusuke Sugomori, which implements basic
    machine learning methods with  many layers (deep learning), including dA (Denoising
    Autoencoder),  SdA (Stacked Denoising Autoencoder), RBM (Restricted Boltzmann machine)
    and  DBN (Deep Belief Nets).
