  summary: Tools for making, retrieving, displaying and solving sudoku games. This package is
    an alternative to the earlier sudoku-solver package, 'sudoku'.  The present package
    uses a slightly different algorithm, has a simpler coding and presents a few more
    sugar tools, such as plot and print methods.  Solved sudoku games are of some interest
    in Experimental Design as examples of Latin Square designs with additional balance
    constraints.
