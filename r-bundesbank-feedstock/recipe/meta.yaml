  summary: Download data from the time-series databases of the Bundesbank, the German central
    bank. See the overview at the Bundesbank website (<https://www.bundesbank.de/en/statistics/time-series-databases>)
    for available series. The package provides only a single function, getSeries(),
    which supports both traditional and real-time datasets; it will also download meta
    data if available. Downloaded data can automatically be arranged in various formats,
    such as data frames or 'zoo' series. The data may optionally be cached, so as to
    avoid repeated downloads of the same series.
