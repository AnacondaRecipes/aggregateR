  summary: Provides tools for conducting Bayesian analyses and Bayesian model averaging (Kass
    and Raftery, 1995, <doi:10.1080/01621459.1995.10476572>, Hoeting et al., 1999, <doi:10.1214/ss/1009212519>).
    The package contains functions for creating a wide range of prior distribution objects,
    mixing posterior samples from 'JAGS' and 'Stan' models, plotting posterior distributions,
    and etc... The tools for working with prior distribution span from visualization,
    generating 'JAGS' and 'bridgesampling' syntax to basic functions such as rng, quantile,
    and distribution functions.
