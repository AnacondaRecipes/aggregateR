  summary: Extract useful time components of a date object, such as day of week, weekend, holiday,
    day of month, etc, and put it in a data frame.  This can be used to create many
    predictor variables out of a single time variable, which can then be used in a regression
    or decision tree.  Also includes function plotCalendarHeatmap which draws a calendar
    and overlays a heatmap based on values.
