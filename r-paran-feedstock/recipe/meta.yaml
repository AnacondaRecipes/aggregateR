  summary: An implementation of Horn's technique for numerically and graphically evaluating the
    components or factors retained in a principle components analysis (PCA) or common
    factor analysis (FA). Horn's method contrasts eigenvalues produced through a PCA
    or FA on a number of random data sets of uncorrelated variables with the same number
    of variables and observations as the experimental or observational data set to produce
    eigenvalues for components or factors that are adjusted for the sample error-induced
    inflation. Components with adjusted eigenvalues greater than one are retained. paran
    may also be used to conduct parallel analysis following Glorfeld's (1995) suggestions
    to reduce the likelihood of over-retention.
