  summary: Do Multi-Reader, Multi-Case (MRMC) analyses of data from imaging studies where clinicians
    (readers) evaluate patient images (cases). What does this mean? ... Many imaging
    studies are designed so that every reader reads every case in all modalities, a
    fully-crossed study. In this case, the data is cross-correlated, and we consider
    the readers and cases to be cross-correlated random effects. An MRMC analysis accounts
    for the variability and correlations from the readers and cases when estimating
    variances, confidence intervals, and p-values. The functions in this package can
    treat arbitrary study designs and studies with missing data, not just fully-crossed
    study designs. The initial package analyzes the reader-average area under the receiver
    operating characteristic (ROC) curve with U-statistics according to Gallas, Bandos,
    Samuelson, and Wagner 2009 <doi:10.1080/03610920802610084>. Additional functions
    analyze other endpoints with U-statistics (binary performance and score differences)
    following the work by Gallas, Pennello, and Myers 2007 <doi:10.1364/JOSAA.24.000B70>.
    Package development and documentation is at <https://github.com/DIDSR/iMRMC/tree/master>.
