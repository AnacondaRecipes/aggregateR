  summary: 'Functions to automate downloading geospatial data available from several federated
    data sources (mainly sources maintained by the US Federal government). Currently,
    the package enables extraction from seven datasets: The National Elevation Dataset
    digital elevation models (1 and 1/3 arc-second; USGS); The National Hydrography
    Dataset (USGS); The Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database from the National Cooperative
    Soil Survey (NCSS), which is led by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
    under the USDA; the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN), coordinated by
    National Climatic Data Center at NOAA; the Daymet gridded estimates of daily weather
    parameters for North America, version 3, available from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory''s
    Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC); the International Tree Ring Data Bank;
    and the National Land Cover Database (NLCD).'
