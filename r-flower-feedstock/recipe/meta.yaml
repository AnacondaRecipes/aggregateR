  summary: Flowering is an important life history trait of flowering plants. It has been mainly
    analyzed with respect to flowering onset and duration of flowering. This tools provide
    some functions to compute the temporal distribution of an flowering individual related
    to other population members. fCV() measures the temporal variation in flowering.
    RIind() measures the rank order of flowering for individual plants within a population.
    SI(), SI2(), SI3(), and SI4() calculate flowering synchrony with different methods.
