  summary: 'Contains various functions for optimal scaling. One function performs optimal scaling
    by maximizing an aspect (i.e. a target function such as the sum of eigenvalues,
    sum of squared correlations, squared multiple correlations, etc.) of the corresponding
    correlation matrix. Another function performs implements the LINEALS approach for
    optimal scaling by minimization of an aspect based on pairwise correlations and
    correlation ratios. The resulting correlation matrix and category scores can be
    used for further multivariate methods such as structural equation models. '
