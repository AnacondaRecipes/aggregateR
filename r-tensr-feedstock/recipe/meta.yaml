  summary: A collection of functions for Kronecker structured covariance estimation and testing
    under the array normal model. For estimation, maximum likelihood and Bayesian equivariant
    estimation procedures are implemented. For testing, a likelihood ratio testing procedure
    is available. This package also contains additional functions for manipulating and
    decomposing tensor data sets. This work was partially supported by NSF grant DMS-1505136.
    Details of the methods are described in Gerard and Hoff (2015) <doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2015.01.020>
    and Gerard and Hoff (2016) <doi:10.1016/j.laa.2016.04.033>.
