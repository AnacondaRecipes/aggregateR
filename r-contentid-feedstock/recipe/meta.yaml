  summary: An interface for creating, registering, and resolving content-based identifiers for
    data management. Content-based identifiers rely on the 'cryptographic' hashes to
    refer to the files they identify, thus, anyone possessing the file can compute the
    identifier using a well-known standard algorithm, such as 'SHA256'.  By registering
    a URL at which the content is accessible to a public archive (such as Hash Archive)
    or depositing data in a scientific repository such 'Zenodo', 'DataONE' or 'SoftwareHeritage',
    the content identifier can serve many functions typically associated with A Digital
    Object Identifier ('DOI').  Unlike location-based identifiers like 'DOIs', content-based
    identifiers permit the same content to be registered in many locations.
