  summary: SaTScan(TM) (http://www.satscan.org) is software for finding regions in Time, Space,
    or Time-Space that have excess risk, based on scan statistics, and uses Monte Carlo
    hypothesis testing to generate P-values for these regions.  The rsatscan package
    provides functions for writing R data frames in SaTScan-readable formats, for setting
    SaTScan parameters, for running SaTScan in the OS, and for reading the files that
    SaTScan creates.
