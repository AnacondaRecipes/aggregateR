  summary: For multiple testing. Computes estimates and confidence bounds for the False Discovery
    Proportion (FDP), the fraction of false positives among all rejected hypotheses.
    The methods in the package use permutations of the data. Doing so, they take into
    account the dependence structure in the data.
