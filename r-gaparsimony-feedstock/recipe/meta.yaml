  summary: Methodology that combines feature selection, model tuning, and parsimonious model
    selection with Genetic Algorithms (GA) proposed in {Martinez-de-Pison} (2015) <DOI:10.1016/j.asoc.2015.06.012>.
    To this objective, a novel GA selection procedure is introduced based on separate
    cost and complexity evaluations.
