  summary: Provides functions to perform reproducible parallel foreach loops, using independent
    random streams as generated by L'Ecuyer's combined multiple-recursive generator
    [L'Ecuyer (1999), <DOI:10.1287/opre.47.1.159>]. It enables to easily convert standard
    %dopar% loops into fully reproducible loops, independently of the number of workers,
    the task scheduling strategy, or the chosen parallel environment and associated
    foreach backend.
