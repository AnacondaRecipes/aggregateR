  summary: "Application of genome prediction for a continuous variable, focused on genotype by
    environment (GE) genomic selection models (GS). It consists a group of functions
    that help to create regression kernels for some GE genomic models proposed by Jarqu\xEDn
    et al. (2014) <doi:10.1007/s00122-013-2243-1> and Lopez-Cruz et al. (2015) <doi:10.1534/g3.114.016097>.
    Also, it computes genomic predictions based on Bayesian approaches. The prediction
    function uses an orthogonal transformation of the data and specific priors present
    by Cuevas et al. (2014) <doi:10.1534/g3.114.013094>."
