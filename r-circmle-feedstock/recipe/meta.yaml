  summary: A series of wrapper functions to implement the 10 maximum likelihood models of animal
    orientation described by Schnute and Groot (1992) <DOI:10.1016/S0003-3472(05)80068-5>.
    The functions also include the ability to use different optimizer methods and calculate
    various model selection metrics (i.e., AIC, AICc, BIC).  The ability to perform
    variants of the Hermans-Rasson test and Pycke test is also included as described
    in Landler et al. (2019) <DOI:10.1186/s12898-019-0246-8>. The latest version also
    includes a new method to calculate circular-circular and circular-linear distance
    correlations.
