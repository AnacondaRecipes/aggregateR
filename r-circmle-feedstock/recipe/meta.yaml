  summary: A series of wrapper functions to implement the 10 maximum likelihood models of animal
    orientation described by Schnute and Groot (1992) <DOI:10.1016/S0003-3472(05)80068-5>.
    The functions also include the ability to use different optimizer methods and calculate
    various model selection metrics (i.e., AIC, AICc, BIC).
