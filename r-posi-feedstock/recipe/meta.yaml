  summary: In linear LS regression, calculate for a given design matrix the multiplier K of coefficient
    standard errors such that the confidence intervals [b - K*SE(b), b + K*SE(b)] have
    a guaranteed coverage probability for all coefficient estimates b in any submodels
    after performing arbitrary model selection.
