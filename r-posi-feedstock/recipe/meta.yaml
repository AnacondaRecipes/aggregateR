  summary: ' In linear LS regression, calculate for a given design matrix the multiplier K of
    coefficient standard errors such that the confidence intervals [b - K*SE(b), b +
    K*SE(b)] have a guaranteed coverage probability for all coefficient estimates b
    in any submodels after performing arbitrary model selection.'
