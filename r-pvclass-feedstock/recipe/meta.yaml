  summary: Computes nonparametric p-values for the potential class memberships of new observations
    as well as cross-validated p-values for the training data. The p-values are based
    on permutation tests applied to an estimated Bayesian likelihood ratio, using a
    plug-in statistic for the Gaussian model, 'k nearest neighbors', 'weighted nearest
    neighbors' or 'penalized logistic regression'. Additionally, it provides graphical
    displays and quantitative analyses of the p-values.
