  summary: Programs to find the sample size or power of studies using the  Sequential Parallel
    Comparison Design (SPCD) and programs to analyze  such studies. This is a clinical
    trial design where  patients initially on placebo who did not respond are re-randomized
    between  placebo and active drug in a second phase and the results of the two phases
    are  pooled. The method of analyzing binary data with this design is described in  Fava,Evins,
    Dorer and Schoenfeld(2003) <doi:10.1159/000069738>, and the  method of analyzing
    continuous data is described in Chen, Yang,  Hung and Wang (2011) <doi:10.1016/j.cct.2011.04.006>.
