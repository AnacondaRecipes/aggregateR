  summary: Contains functions to calculate power and sample size for various study designs used
    in bioequivalence studies. Use known.designs() to see the designs supported. Power
    and sample size can be obtained based on different methods, amongst them prominently
    the TOST procedure (two one-sided t-tests). See README and NEWS for further information.
