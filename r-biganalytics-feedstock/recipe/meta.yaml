  summary: Extend the 'bigmemory' package with various analytics. Functions 'bigkmeans' and 'binit'
    may also be used with native R objects. For 'tapply'-like functions, the bigtabulate
    package may also be helpful. For linear algebra support, see 'bigalgebra'.  For
    mutex (locking) support for advanced shared-memory usage, see 'synchronicity'.
