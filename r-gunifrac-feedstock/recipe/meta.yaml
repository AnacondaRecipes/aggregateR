  summary: 'A suite of methods for powerful and robust microbiome data analysis including data
    normalization, data simulation, community-level association testing and differential
    abundance analysis. It implements generalized UniFrac distances,  Geometric Mean
    of Pairwise Ratios (GMPR) normalization, semiparametric data simulator, distance-based
    statistical methods, and feature-based statistical methods. The distance-based statistical
    methods include three extensions of PERMANOVA: (1) PERMANOVA using the Freedman-Lane
    permutation scheme, (2) PERMANOVA omnibus test using multiple matrices, and  (3)
    analytical approach to approximating PERMANOVA p-value. Feature-based statistical
    methods include linear model-based methods for differential abundance analysis of
    zero-inflated high-dimensional compositional data.'
