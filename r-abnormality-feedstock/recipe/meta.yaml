  summary: "Contains the functions to implement the methodology and considerations laid out by
    Marks et al. in the manuscript Measuring Abnormality in High Dimensional Spaces:
    Applications in Biomechanical Gait Analysis. As of 2/27/2018 this paper has been
    submitted and is under scientific review. Using high-dimensional datasets to measure
    a subject\u2019s overall level of abnormality as compared to a reference population
    is often needed in outcomes research. Utilizing applications in instrumented gait
    analysis, that article demonstrates how using data that is inherently non-independent
    to measure overall abnormality may bias results. A methodology is introduced to
    address this bias to accurately measure overall abnormality in high dimensional
    spaces. While this methodology is in line with previous literature, it differs in
    two major ways. Advantageously, it can be applied to datasets in which the number
    of observations is less than the number of features/variables, and it can be abstracted
    to practically any number of domains or dimensions. After applying the proposed
    methodology to the original data, the researcher is left with a set of uncorrelated
    variables (i.e. principal components) with which overall abnormality can be measured
    without bias. Different considerations are discussed in that article in deciding
    the appropriate number of principal components to keep and the aggregate distance
    measure to utilize."
