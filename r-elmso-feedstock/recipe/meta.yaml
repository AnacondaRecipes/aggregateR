  summary: An implementation of the algorithm described in "Efficient Large- Scale Internet Media
    Selection Optimization for Online Display Advertising" by Paulson, Luo, and James
    (Journal of Marketing Research 2018; see URL below for journal text/citation and
    <http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/Research/ELMSO.pdf> for a full-text
    version of the paper). The algorithm here is designed to allocate budget across
    a set of online advertising opportunities using a coordinate-descent approach, but
    it can be used in any resource-allocation problem with a matrix of visitation (in
    the case of the paper, website page- views) and channels (in the paper, websites).
    The package contains allocation functions both in the presence of bidding, when
    allocation is dependent on channel-specific cost curves, and when advertising costs
    are fixed at each channel.
