  summary: An implementation of the algorithm described in "Efficient Large- Scale Internet Media
    Selection Optimization for Online Display Advertising" by Paulson, Luo, and James
    (Journal of Marketing Research 2018; see URL below for journal text/citation and
    <http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/research/ELMSO.pdf> for a full-text version of the
    paper). The algorithm here is designed to  allocate budget across a set of online
    advertising opportunities using a  coordinate-descent approach, but it can be used
    in any resource-allocation  problem with a matrix of visitation (in the case of
    the paper, website page- views) and channels (in the paper, websites). The package
    contains allocation functions both in the presence of bidding, when allocation is
    dependent on  channel-specific cost curves, and when advertising costs are fixed
    at each channel.
