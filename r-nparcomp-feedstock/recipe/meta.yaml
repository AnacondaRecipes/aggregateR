  summary: With this package, it is possible to compute nonparametric simultaneous confidence
    intervals for relative contrast effects in the unbalanced one way layout. Moreover,
    it computes simultaneous p-values. The simultaneous confidence intervals can be
    computed using multivariate normal distribution, multivariate t-distribution with
    a Satterthwaite Approximation of the degree of freedom or using multivariate range
    preserving transformations with Logit or Probit as transformation function. 2 sample
    comparisons can be performed with the same methods described above. There is no
    assumption on the underlying distribution function, only that the data have to be
    at least ordinal numbers. See Konietschke et al. (2015) <doi:10.18637/jss.v064.i09>
    for details.
