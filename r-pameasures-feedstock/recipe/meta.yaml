  summary: We propose a pair of summary measures for the predictive power of a prediction function
    based on a regression model. The regression model can be linear or nonlinear, parametric,
    semi-parametric, or nonparametric, and correctly specified or mis-specified. The
    first measure, R-squared, is an extension of the classical R-squared statistic for
    a linear model, quantifying the prediction function's ability to capture the variability
    of the response. The second measure, L-squared, quantifies the prediction function's
    bias for predicting the mean regression function. When used together, they give
    a complete summary of the predictive power of a prediction function. Please refer
    to Gang Li and Xiaoyan Wang (2016) <arXiv:1611.03063> for more details.
