  summary: Insert/extract text "reminders" into/from function source code comments or as the
    "comment" attribute of any object. The former can be handy in development as reminders
    of e.g. argument requirements, expected objects in the calling environment, required
    options settings, etc. The latter can be used to provide information of the object
    and as simple manual "tooltips" for users, among other things.
