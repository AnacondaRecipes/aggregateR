  summary: This tool, wood vision tool, is intended to facilitate preprocessing and analyzing
    2-dimensional wood images toward automated recognition. The former includes some
    basics such as functions to RGB to grayscale, gray to binary, cropping, rotation(bilinear),
    median/mean/Gaussian filter, and Canny/Sobel edge detection. The latter includes
    gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), Haralick parameters, local binary pattern
    (LBP), higher order local autocorrelation (HLAC), Fourier transform (radial and
    azimuthal integration), and Gabor filtering. The functions are intended to read
    data using  'readTIFF(x,info=T)' from 'tiff' package. The functions in this packages
    basically assumes the grayscale images as input data, thus the color images should
    be subjected to the function rgb2gray() before used for some other functions.
