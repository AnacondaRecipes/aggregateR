  summary: Discriminant analysis and data clustering methods for high dimensional data, based
    on the assumption that high-dimensional data live in different subspaces with low
    dimensionality proposing a new parametrization of the Gaussian mixture model which
    combines the ideas of dimension reduction and constraints on the model.
