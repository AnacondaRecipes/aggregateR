  summary: Provides a quick method for visualizing non-aggregated line-list or aggregated census
    data stratified by age and one or two categorical variables (e.g. gender and health
    status) with any number of values. It returns a 'ggplot' object, allowing the user
    to further customize the output. This package is part of the 'R4Epis' project <https://r4epis.netlify.app/>.
