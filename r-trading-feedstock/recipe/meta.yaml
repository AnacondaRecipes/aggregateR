  summary: Contains trades from the five major assets classes and also functionality to use pricing
    curves, rating tables, CSAs and add-on tables. The implementation follows an object
    oriented logic whereby each trade inherits from more abstract classes while also
    the curves/tables are objects. There is a lot of functionality focusing on the counterparty
    credit risk calculations however the package can be used for trading applications
    in general.
