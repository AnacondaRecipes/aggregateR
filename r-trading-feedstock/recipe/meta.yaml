  summary: Contains performance analysis metrics of track records including entropy-based correlation
    and dynamic beta based on the Kalman filter. The normalized sample entropy method
    has been implemented which produces accurate entropy estimation even on smaller
    datasets while for the dynamic beta calculation the Kalman filter methodology has
    been utilized. On a separate stream, trades from the five major assets classes and
    also functionality to use pricing curves, rating tables, CSAs and add-on tables.
    The implementation follows an object oriented logic whereby each trade inherits
    from more abstract classes while also the curves/tables are objects. There is a
    lot of functionality focusing on the counterparty credit risk calculations however
    the package can be used for trading applications in general.
