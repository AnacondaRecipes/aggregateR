  summary: A tool to use a principal component analysis on radially averaged two dimensional
    Fourier spectra to characterize image texture. The method within the context of
    ecology was first described by Couteron et al. (2005) <doi:10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01097.x>
    and expanded upon by Solorzano et al. (2018) <doi:10.1117/1.JRS.12.036006> using
    a moving window approach.
