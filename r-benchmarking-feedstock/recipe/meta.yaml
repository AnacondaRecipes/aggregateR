  summary: Methods for frontier analysis, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), under different technology
    assumptions (fdh, vrs, drs, crs, irs, add/frh, and fdh+), and using different efficiency
    measures (input based, output based, hyperbolic graph, additive, super, and directional
    efficiency). Peers and slacks are available, partial price information can be included,
    and optimal cost, revenue and profit can be calculated. Evaluation of mergers is
    also supported.  Methods for graphing the technology sets are also included. There
    is also support for comparative methods based on Stochastic Frontier Analyses (SFA)
    and for convex nonparametric least squares of convex functions (STONED). In general,
    the methods can be used to solve not only standard models, but also many other model
    variants. It complements the book, Bogetoft and Otto, Benchmarking with DEA, SFA,
    and R, Springer-Verlag, 2011, but can of course also be used as a stand-alone package.
