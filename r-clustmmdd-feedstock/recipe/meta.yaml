  summary: 'An implementation of a variable selection procedure in clustering by mixture models
    for discrete data (clustMMDD). Genotype data are examples of such data with two
    unordered observations (alleles) at each locus for diploid individual. The two-fold
    problem of variable selection and clustering is seen as a model selection problem
    where competing models are characterized by the number of clusters K, and the subset
    S of clustering variables. Competing models are compared by penalized maximum likelihood
    criteria. We considered asymptotic criteria such as Akaike and Bayesian Information
    criteria, and a family of penalized criteria with penalty function to be data driven
    calibrated. '
