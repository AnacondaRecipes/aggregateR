  summary: Efficient statistical inference of two-sample MR (Mendelian Randomization) analysis.  It
    can account for the correlated instruments and the horizontal pleiotropy,  and can
    provide the accurate estimates of both causal effect and horizontal  pleiotropy
    effect as well as the two corresponding p-values. There are two main  functions
    in the 'PPMR' package. One is PMR_individual() for individual level data,  the other
    is PMR_summary() for summary data.
