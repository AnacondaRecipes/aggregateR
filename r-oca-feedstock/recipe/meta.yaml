  summary: "Computes optimal capital allocations based on some standard principles such as Haircut,
    Overbeck type II and the Covariance Allocation Principle. It also provides some
    shortcuts for obtaining the Value at Risk and the Expectation Shortfall, using both
    the normal and the t-student distribution, see Urbina and Guill\xE9n (2014)<doi:10.1016/j.eswa.2014.05.017>
