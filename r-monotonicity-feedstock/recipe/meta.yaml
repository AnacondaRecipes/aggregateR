  summary: Test for monotonicity in financial variables sorted by portfolios. It is conventional
    practice in empirical research to form portfolios of assets ranked by a certain
    sort variable. A t-test is then used to consider the mean return spread between
    the portfolios with the highest and lowest values of the sort variable. Yet comparing
    only the average returns on the top and bottom portfolios does not provide a sufficient
    way to test for a monotonic relation between expected returns and the sort variable.
    This package provides nonparametric tests for the full set of monotonic patterns
    by Patton, A. and Timmermann, A. (2010) <doi:10.1016/j.jfineco.2010.06.006> and
    compares the proposed results with extant alternatives such as t-tests, Bonferroni
    bounds, and multivariate inequality tests through empirical applications and simulations.
