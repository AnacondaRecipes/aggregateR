  summary: 'An implementation of the ''k-means--'' algorithm proposed by Chawla and Gionis, 2013
    in their paper, "k-means-- : A unified approach to clustering and outlier detection.
    SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM13)", <doi:10.1137/1.9781611972832.21>
    and using ''ordering'' described by Howe, 2013 in the thesis, Clustering and anomaly
    detection in tropical cyclones". Useful for creating (potentially) tighter clusters
    than standard k-means and simultaneously finding outliers inexpensively in multidimensional
    space.'
