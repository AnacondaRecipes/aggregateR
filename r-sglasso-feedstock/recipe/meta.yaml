  summary: RCON(V, E) models are a kind of restriction of the Gaussian Graphical Models defined
    by a set of equality constraints on the entries of the concentration matrix. 'sglasso'
    package implements the structured graphical lasso (sglasso) estimator proposed in
    Abbruzzo et al. (2014) for the weighted l1-penalized RCON(V, E) model. Two cyclic
    coordinate algorithms are implemented to compute the sglasso estimator, i.e. a cyclic
    coordinate minimization (CCM) and a cyclic coordinate descent (CCD) algorithm.
