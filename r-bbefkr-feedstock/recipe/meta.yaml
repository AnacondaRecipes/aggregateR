  summary: Estimating optimal bandwidths for the regression mean function approximated by the
    functional Nadaraya-Watson estimator and the error density approximated by a kernel
    density of residuals simultaneously in a scalar-on-function regression. As a by-product
    of Markov chain Monte Carlo, the optimal choice of semi-metric is selected based
    on largest marginal likelihood.
