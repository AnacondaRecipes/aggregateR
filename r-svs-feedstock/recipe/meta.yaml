  summary: Various tools for semantic vector spaces, such as correspondence analysis (simple,
    multiple and discriminant), latent semantic analysis, probabilistic latent semantic
    analysis, non-negative matrix factorization, latent class analysis and EM clustering.
    Furthermore, there are specialized distance measures, plotting functions and some
    helper functions.
