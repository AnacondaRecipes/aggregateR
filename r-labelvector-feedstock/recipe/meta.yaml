  summary: Labels are a common construct in statistical software providing a  human readable
    description of a variable. While variable names are succinct, quick to type, and
    follow a language's naming conventions, labels may  be more illustrative and may
    use plain text and spaces. R does not provide native support for labels. Some packages,
    however, have made this feature available.  Most notably, the 'Hmisc' package provides
    labelling methods for a number of different object. Due to design decisions, these
    methods are not all exported, and so are unavailable for use in package development.
    The 'labelVector' package supports labels for atomic vectors in a light-weight design
    that is suitable for use in other packages.
