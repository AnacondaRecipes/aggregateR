  summary: Labels are a common construct in statistical software providing a human readable description
    of a variable. While variable names are succinct, quick to type, and follow a language's
    naming conventions, labels may be more illustrative and may use plain text and spaces.
    R does not provide native support for labels. Some packages, however, have made
    this feature available.  Most notably, the 'Hmisc' package provides labelling methods
    for a number of different object. Due to design decisions, these methods are not
    all exported, and so are unavailable for use in package development. The 'labelVector'
    package supports labels for atomic vectors in a light-weight design that is suitable
    for use in other packages.
