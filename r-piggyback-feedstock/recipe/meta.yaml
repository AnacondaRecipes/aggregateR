  summary: Because larger (> 50 MB) data files cannot easily be committed to git, a different
    approach is required to manage data associated with an analysis in a GitHub repository.  This
    package provides a simple work-around by allowing larger (up to 2 GB) data files
    to piggyback on a repository as assets attached to individual GitHub releases.  These
    files are not handled by git in any way, but instead are uploaded, downloaded, or
    edited directly by calls through the GitHub API. These data files can be versioned
    manually by creating different releases.  This approach works equally well with
    public or private repositories.  Data can be uploaded and downloaded programmatically
    from scripts. No authentication is required to download data from public repositories.
