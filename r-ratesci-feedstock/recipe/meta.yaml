  summary: Computes confidence intervals for the rate (or risk) difference ('RD') or rate ratio
    (or relative risk, 'RR') for  binomial proportions or Poisson rates, or for odds
    ratio  ('OR', binomial only). Also confidence intervals for a single  binomial or
    Poisson rate, and intervals for matched pairs.  Includes skewness-corrected asymptotic
    score ('SCAS') methods,  which have been developed in Laud (2017) <doi:10.1002/pst.1813>
    from Miettinen & Nurminen (1985) <doi:10.1002/sim.4780040211> and  Gart & Nam (1988)
    <doi:10.2307/2531848>. Also includes MOVER methods (Method Of Variance Estimates
    Recovery) for all contrasts, derived  from the Newcombe method but using equal-tailed
    Jeffreys intervals, and generalised for Bayesian applications incorporating prior  information.
    So-called 'exact' methods for strictly conservative  coverage are approximated using
    continuity corrections. Also includes methods for stratified calculations (e.g.
    meta-analysis), either assuming fixed effects or incorporating stratum heterogeneity.
