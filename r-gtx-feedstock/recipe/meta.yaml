  summary: Assorted tools for genetic association analyses.  The current focus is on implementing
    (either exactly or approximately) regression analyses using summary statistics instead
    of using subject-specific data.  So far, functions exist to support multi-SNP risk
    score analyses, multi-SNP conditional regression analyses, and multi-phenotype analyses,
    using summary statistics.  There are helper functions for reading and manipulating
    subject-specific genotype data, which provide a platform for calculating the summary
    statistics, or for using R to conduct other analyses not supported by specific GWAS
    analysis tools.
