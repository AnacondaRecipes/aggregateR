  summary: Implementation of a function which calculates the empirical excess mass for given
    \eqn{\lambda} and given maximal number of modes (excessm()). Offering powerful plot
    features to visualize empirical excess mass (exmplot()). This includes the possibility
    of drawing several plots (with different maximal number of modes / cut off values)
    in a single graph.
