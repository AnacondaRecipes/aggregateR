  summary: Differential exon usage test for RNA-Seq data via an empirical Bayes shrinkage method
    for the dispersion parameter the utilizes inclusion-exclusion data to analyze the
    propensity to skip an exon across groups. The input data consists of two matrices
    where each row represents an exon and the columns represent the biological samples.
    The first matrix is the count of the number of reads expressing the exon for each
    sample. The second matrix is the count of the number of reads that either express
    the exon or explicitly skip the exon across the samples, a.k.a. the total count
    matrix. Dividing the two matrices yields proportions representing the propensity
    to express the exon versus skipping the exon for each sample.
