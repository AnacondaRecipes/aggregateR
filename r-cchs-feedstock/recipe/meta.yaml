  summary: Contains a function, also called 'cchs', that calculates Estimator III of Borgan et
    al (2000), <DOI:10.1023/A:1009661900674>. This estimator is for fitting a Cox proportional
    hazards model to data from a case-cohort study where the subcohort was selected
    by stratified simple random sampling.
