  summary: It has tools for normalization of rank abundance distributions (RAD) to a desired
    number of ranks using MaxRank Normalization method. RADs are commonly used in biology/ecology
    and mathematically equivalent to complementary cumulative distributions (CCDFs)
    which are used in physics, linguistics and sociology and more generally in data
    science.
