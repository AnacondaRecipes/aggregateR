  summary: An automatic cell type detection and assignment algorithm for single cell RNA-Seq
    and Cytof/FACS data. 'SCINA' is capable of assigning cell type identities to a pool
    of cells profiled by scRNA-Seq or Cytof/FACS data with prior knowledge of markers,
    such as genes and protein symbols that are highly or lowly expressed in each category.
    See Zhang Z, et al (2019) <doi:10.3390/genes10070531> for more details.
