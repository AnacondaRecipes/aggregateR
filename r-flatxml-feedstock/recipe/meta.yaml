  summary: On import, the XML information is converted to a dataframe that reflects the hierarchical
    XML structure. Intuitive functions allow to navigate within this transparent XML
    data structure (without any knowledge of 'XPath'). 'flatXML' also provides tools
    to extract data from the XML into a flat dataframe that can be used to perform statistical
    operations.
