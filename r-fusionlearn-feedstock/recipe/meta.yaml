  summary: The fusion learning method uses a model selection algorithm to learn from multiple
    data sets across different experimental platforms through group penalization. The
    responses of interest may include a mix of discrete and continuous variables. The
    responses may share the same set of predictors, however, the models and parameters
    differ across different platforms. Integrating information from different data sets
    can enhance the power of model selection. Package is based on Xin Gao, Raymond J.
    Carroll (2017) <arXiv:1610.00667v1>.
