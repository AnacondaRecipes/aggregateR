  summary: 'Provides weighted versions of several metrics and performance measures used in machine
    learning, including average unit deviances of the Bernoulli, Tweedie, Poisson, and
    Gamma distributions, see Jorgensen B. (1997, ISBN: 978-0412997112).  The package
    also contains a weighted version of generalized R-squared, see e.g. Cohen, J. et
    al. (2002, ISBN: 978-0805822236).  Furthermore, ''dplyr'' chains are supported.'
