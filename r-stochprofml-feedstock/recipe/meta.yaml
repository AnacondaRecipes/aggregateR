  summary: This is an R package accompanying the paper "Parameterizing cell-to-cell regulatory
    heterogeneities via stochastic transcriptional profiles" by Sameer S Bajikar, Christiane
    Fuchs, Andreas Roller, Fabian J Theis and Kevin A Janes (PNAS 2014, 111(5), E626-635).
    In this paper, we measure expression profiles from small heterogeneous populations
    of cells, where each cell is assumed to be from a mixture of lognormal distributions.
    We perform maximum likelihood estimation in order to infer the mixture ratio and
    the parameters of these lognormal distributions from the cumulated expression measurements.
