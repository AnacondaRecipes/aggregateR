  summary: Provides a general framework for clinical trial simulations based on the Clinical
    Scenario Evaluation (CSE) approach. The package supports a broad class of data models
    (including clinical trials with continuous, binary, survival-type and count-type
    endpoints as well as multivariate outcomes that are based on combinations of different
    endpoints), analysis strategies and commonly used evaluation criteria.
