  summary: The spatial interpolation of genetic distances between samples is based on a modified
    kriging method that accepts a genetic distance matrix and generates a map of probability
    of lineage presence. This package also offers tools to generate a map of  potential
    contact zones between groups with user-defined thresholds in the tree to account
    for old and recent divergence. Additionally, it has functions for IDW interpolation
    using genetic data and midpoints.
