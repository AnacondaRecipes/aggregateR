  summary: It provides users with a wide range of tools to simulate, estimate, analyze, and visualize
    the dynamics of stochastic differential systems in both forms Ito and Stratonovich.
    Statistical analysis with parallel Monte Carlo and moment equations methods of SDEs
    <doi:10.18637/jss.v096.i02>. Enabled many searchers in different domains to use
    these equations to modeling practical problems in financial and actuarial modeling
    and other areas of application, e.g., modeling and simulate of first passage time
    problem in shallow water using the attractive center (Boukhetala K, 1996) ISBN:1-56252-342-2.
