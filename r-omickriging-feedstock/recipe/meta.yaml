  summary: 'It provides functions to generate a correlation matrix from a genetic dataset and
    to use this matrix to predict the phenotype of an individual by using the phenotypes
    of the remaining individuals through kriging. Kriging is a geostatistical method
    for optimal prediction or best unbiased linear prediction. It consists of predicting
    the value of a variable at an unobserved location as a weighted sum of the variable
    at observed locations. Intuitively, it works as a reverse linear regression: instead
    of computing correlation (univariate regression coefficients are simply scaled correlation)
    between a dependent variable Y and independent variables X, it uses known correlation
    between X and Y to predict Y.'
