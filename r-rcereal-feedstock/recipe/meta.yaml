  summary: To facilitate using 'cereal' with Rcpp. 'cereal' is a header-only C++11 serialization
    library. 'cereal' takes arbitrary data types and reversibly turns them into different
    representations, such as compact binary encodings, XML, or JSON. 'cereal' was designed
    to be fast, light-weight, and easy to extend - it has no external dependencies and
    can be easily bundled with other code or used standalone. Please see <http://uscilab.github.io/cereal>
    for more information.
