  summary: 'Time series outlier detection with non parametric test. This is a new outlier detection
    methodology (washer): efficient for time saving elaboration and implementation procedures,
    adaptable for general assumptions and for needing very short time series, reliable
    and effective as involving robust non parametric test. You can find two approaches:
    single time series (a vector) and grouped time series (a data frame). For other
    informations: Andrea Venturini (2011) Statistica - Universita di Bologna, Vol.71,
    pp.329-344. For an informal explanation look at R-bloggers on web.'
