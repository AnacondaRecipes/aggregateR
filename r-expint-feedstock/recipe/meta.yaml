  summary: The exponential integrals E_1(x), E_2(x), E_n(x) and Ei(x), and the incomplete gamma
    function G(a, x) defined for negative values of its first argument. The package
    also gives easy access to the underlying C routines through an API; see the package
    vignette for details. A test package included in sub-directory example_API provides
    an implementation. C routines derived from the GNU Scientific Library <https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>.
