  summary: This package implements a thresholded version of the EEBoost algorithm described in
    [Wolfson (2011, JASA)]. EEBoost is a general-purpose method for variable selection
    which can be applied whenever inference would be based on an estimating equation.
    The package currently implements variable selection based on the Generalized Estimating
    Equations, but can also accommodate user-provided estimating functions. Thresholded
    EEBoost is a generalization which allows multiple variables to enter the model at
    each boosting step.
