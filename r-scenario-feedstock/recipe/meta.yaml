  summary: Uses the neural gas algorithm to construct a scenario tree for use in multi-stage
    stochastic programming. The primary input is a set of initial scenarios or realizations
    of a disturbance. The scenario tree nodal structure must be predefined using a scenario
    tree nodal partition matrix.
