  summary: Purpose of this package is it to plan, monitor and evaluate oncological phase II studies.
    In general this kind of studies are single-arm trials with planned interim analysis
    and binary endpoint. To meet the resulting requirements, the package provides functions
    to calculate and evaluate 'Simon's two-stage designs' and 'so-called' 'subset designs'.
    If you are unfamiliar with this package a good starting point is to take a closer
    look at the functions getSolutions() and getSolutionsSub1().The web-based tool (<https://imbi.shinyapps.io/phaseII-app/>)
    extends the functionality of our R package by means of a proper dealing with over-
    and underrunning. The R function binom.test of the 'stats' R package and the package
    'binom' might be  helpful to assess the performance of the corresponding one-stage
    design as a reference.
