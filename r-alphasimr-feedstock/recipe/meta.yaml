  summary: The successor to the 'AlphaSim' software for breeding program simulation [Faux et
    al. (2016) <doi:10.3835/plantgenome2016.02.0013>]. Used for stochastic simulations
    of breeding programs to the level of DNA sequence for every individual. Contained
    is a wide range of functions for modeling common tasks in a breeding program, such
    as selection and crossing. These functions allow for constructing simulations of
    highly complex plant and animal breeding programs via scripting in the R software
    environment. Such simulations can be used to evaluate overall breeding program performance
    and conduct research into breeding program design, such as implementation of genomic
    selection. Included is the 'Markovian Coalescent Simulator' ('MaCS') for fast simulation
    of biallelic sequences according to a population demographic history [Chen et al.
    (2009) <doi:10.1101/gr.083634.108>].
