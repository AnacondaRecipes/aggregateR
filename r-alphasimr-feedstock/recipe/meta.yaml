  summary: The successor to the 'AlphaSim' software for breeding program  simulation [Faux et
    al. (2016) <doi:10.3835/plantgenome2016.02.0013>].  Used for stochastic simulations
    of breeding programs to the level of DNA  sequence for every individual. Contained
    is a wide range of functions for  modeling common tasks in a breeding program, such
    as selection and crossing.  These functions allow for constructing simulations of
    highly complex plant and  animal breeding programs via scripting in the R software
    environment. Such  simulations can be used to evaluate overall breeding program
    performance and  conduct research into breeding program design, such as implementation
    of  genomic selection. Included is the 'Markovian Coalescent Simulator' ('MaCS')  for
    fast simulation of biallelic sequences according to a population  demographic history
    [Chen et al. (2009) <doi:10.1101/gr.083634.108>].
