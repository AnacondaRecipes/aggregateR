  summary: "Fit restricted mean models for the conditional association between an exposure and
    an outcome, given covariates. Three methods are implemented: O-estimation, where
    a nuisance model for the association between the covariates and the outcome is used;
    E-estimation where a nuisance model for the association between the covariates and
    the exposure is used, and doubly robust (DR) estimation where both nuisance models
    are used. In DR-estimation, the estimates will be consistent when at least one of
    the nuisance models is correctly specified, not necessarily both. For more information,
    see Zetterqvist and Sj\xF6lander (2015) <doi:10.1515/em-2014-0021>."
