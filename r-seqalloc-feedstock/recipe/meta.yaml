  summary: Potential randomization schemes are prospectively evaluated when units are assigned
    to treatment arms upon entry into the experiment. The schemes are evaluated for
    balance on covariates and on predictability (i.e., how well could a site worker
    guess the treatment of the next unit enrolled).
