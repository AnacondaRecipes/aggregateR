  summary: Simple methods to generate attractive random colors. The random colors are from a
    wrapper of 'randomColor.js' <https://github.com/davidmerfield/randomColor>. In addition,
    it also generates optimally distinct colors based on k-means (inspired by 'IWantHue'
    <https://github.com/medialab/iwanthue>).
