  summary: A parallel implementation of Weighted Subspace Random Forest.  The Weighted Subspace
    Random Forest algorithm was proposed in the International Journal of Data Warehousing
    and Mining by Baoxun Xu, Joshua Zhexue Huang, Graham Williams, Qiang Wang, and Yunming
    Ye (2012) <DOI:10.4018/jdwm.2012040103>.  The algorithm can classify very high-dimensional
    data with random forests built using small subspaces.  A novel variable weighting
    method is used for variable subspace selection in place of the traditional random
    variable sampling.This new approach is particularly useful in building models from
    high-dimensional data.
