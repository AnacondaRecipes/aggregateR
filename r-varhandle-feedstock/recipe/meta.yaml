  summary: Variables are the fundamental parts of each programming language but handling them
    efficiently might be frustrating for programmers. This package contains some functions
    to help user (especially data explorers) to make more sense of their variables and
    take the most out of variables and hardware resources. These functions are written
    and crafted since 2014 with years of experience in statistical data analysis on
    high-dimensional data, and for each of them there was a need. Functions in this
    package are supposed to be efficient and easy to use, hence they will be frequently
    updated to make them more convenient.
