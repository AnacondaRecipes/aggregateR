  summary: The efficient treatment and convenient analysis of experimental high-throughput (omics)
    data gets facilitated through this collection of diverse functions. Several functions
    address advanced object-conversions, like manipulating lists of lists or lists of
    arrays, reorganizing lists to arrays or into separate vectors, merging of multiple
    entries, etc. Another set of functions provides speed-optimized calculation of standard
    deviation (sd), coefficient of variance (CV) or standard error of the mean (SEM)
    for data in matrixes or means per line with respect to additional grouping (eg n
    groups of replicates). Other functions facilitate dealing with non-redundant information,
    by indexing unique, adding counters to redundant or eliminating lines with respect
    redundancy in a given reference-column, etc. Help is provided to identify very closely
    matching numeric values to generate (partial) distance matrixes for very big data
    in a memory efficient manner or to reduce the complexity of large data-sets by combining
    very close values. Many times large experimental datasets need some additional filtering,
    adequate functions are provided. Batch reading (or writing) of sets of files and
    combining data to arrays is supported, too. Convenient data normalization is supported
    in various different modes, parameter estimation via permutations or boot-strap
    as well as flexible testing of multiple pair-wise combinations using the framework
    of 'limma' is provided, too.
