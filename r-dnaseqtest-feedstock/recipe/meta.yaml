  summary: Generates DNA sequences based on Markov model techniques for matched sequences. This
    can be generalized to several sequences. The sequences (taxa) are then arranged
    in an evolutionary tree (phylogenetic tree) depicting how taxa diverge from their
    common ancestors. This gives the tests and estimation methods for the parameters
    of different models. Standard phylogenetic methods assume stationarity, homogeneity
    and reversibility for the Markov processes, and  often impose further restrictions
    on the parameters.
