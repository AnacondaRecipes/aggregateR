  summary: Forms queries to submit to the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank web site's financial
    stress index data site.  Provides query functions for both the composite stress
    index and the components data. By default the download includes daily time series
    data starting September 25, 1991.  The functions return a class of either type easing
    or cfsi which contain a list of items related to the query and its graphical presentation.  The
    list includes the time series data as an xts object.  The package provides four
    lattice time series plots to render the time series data in a manner similar to
    the bank's own presentation.
