  summary: "Many complex diseases are known to be affected by the interactions between genetic
    variants and environmental exposures beyond the main genetic and environmental effects.
    Existing Bayesian methods for gene-environment (G\xD7E) interaction studies are
    challenged by the high-dimensional nature of the study and the complexity of environmental
    influences. We have developed a novel and powerful semi-parametric Bayesian variable
    selection method that can accommodate linear and nonlinear G\xD7E interactions simultaneously
    (Ren et al. (2019) <arXiv:1906.01057>). Furthermore, the proposed method can conduct
    structural identification by distinguishing nonlinear interactions from main effects
    only case within Bayesian framework. Spike-and-slab priors are incorporated on both
    individual and group level to shrink coefficients corresponding to irrelevant main
    and interaction effects to zero exactly. The Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms
    of the proposed and alternative methods are  efficiently implemented in C++."

# Description: Many complex diseases are known to be affected by the interactions between genetic variants and environmental exposures beyond the main genetic and environmental effects. Existing Bayesian methods for gene-environment (GE) interaction studies are challenged by the high-dimensional nature of the study and the complexity of environmental influences. We have developed a novel and powerful semi-parametric Bayesian variable selection method that can accommodate linear and nonlinear GE interactions simultaneously (Ren et al. (2019) <arXiv:1906.01057>). Furthermore, the proposed method can conduct structural identification by distinguishing nonlinear interactions from main effects only case within Bayesian framework. Spike-and-slab priors are incorporated on both individual and group level to shrink coefficients corresponding to irrelevant main and interaction effects to zero exactly. The Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms of the proposed and alternative methods are  efficiently implemented in C++.
