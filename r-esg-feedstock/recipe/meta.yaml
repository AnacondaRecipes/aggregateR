  summary: Presents a "Scenarios" class containing general parameters, risk parameters and projection
    results. Risk parameters are gathered together into a ParamsScenarios sub-object.
    The general process for using this package is to set all needed parameters in a
    Scenarios object, use the customPathsGeneration method to proceed to the projection,
    then use xxx_PriceDistribution() methods to get asset prices.
