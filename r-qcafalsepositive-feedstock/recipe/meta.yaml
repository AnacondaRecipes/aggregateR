  summary: 'Implements tests for Type I error in Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) that
    take into account the multiple hypothesis tests inherent in the procedure. Tests
    can be carried out on three variants of QCA: crisp-set QCA (csQCA), multi-value
    QCA (mvQCA) and fuzzy-set QCA (fsQCA). For fsQCA, the fsQCApermTest() command implements
    a permutation test that provides 95% confidence intervals for the number of counterexamples
    and degree of consistency, respectively. The distributions of permuted values can
    be plotted against the observed values. For csQCA and mvQCA, simple binomial tests
    are implemented in csQCAbinTest() and mvQCAbinTest(), respectively.'
