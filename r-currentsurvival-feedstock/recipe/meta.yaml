  summary: The currentSurvival package contains functions for the estimation of the current cumulative
    incidence (CCI) and the current leukaemia-free survival (CLFS). The CCI is the probability
    that a patient is alive and in any disease remission (e.g. complete cytogenetic
    remission in chronic myeloid leukaemia) after initiating his or her therapy (e.g.
    tyrosine kinase therapy for chronic myeloid leukaemia). The CLFS is the probability
    that a patient is alive and in any disease remission after achieving the first disease
    remission.
