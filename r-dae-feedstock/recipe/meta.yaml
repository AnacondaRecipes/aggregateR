  summary: 'The content falls into the following groupings: (i) Data, (ii) Factor manipulation
    functions, (iii) Design functions, (iv) ANOVA functions, (v) Matrix functions, (vi)
    Projector and canonical efficiency functions, and (vii) Miscellaneous functions.
    There is a vignette describing how to use the design functions for randomizing and
    assessing designs available as a vignette called ''DesignNotes''. The ANOVA functions
    facilitate the extraction of information when the ''Error'' function has been used
    in the call to ''aov''. The package ''dae'' can also be installed from <http://chris.brien.name/rpackages/>.'
