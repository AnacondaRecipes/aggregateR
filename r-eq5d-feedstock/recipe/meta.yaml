  summary: 'EQ-5D is a popular health related quality of life instrument used  in the clinical
    and economic evaluation of health care. Developed by the  EuroQol group <https://www.euroqol.org>,
    the instrument consists of two  components: health state description and evaluation.
    For the description  component a subject self-rates their health in terms of five
    dimensions;  mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and  anxiety/depression
    using either a three-level (EQ-5D-3L, <https://www.euroqol.org/eq-5d-instruments/eq-5d-3l-about>)
    or a five-level (EQ-5D-5L, <https://www.euroqol.org/eq-5d-instruments/eq-5d-5l-about>)  scale.
    Frequently the scores on these five dimensions are converted to a  single utility
    index using country specific value sets, which can be used in the clinical and economic
    evaluation of health care as well as in  population health surveys. The eq5d package
    provides methods to calculate  index scores from a subject''s dimension scores.
    19 TTO and 9 VAS EQ-5D-3L value  sets including those for countries in Szende et
    al (2007)  <doi:10.1007/1-4020-5511-0> and Szende et al (2014)  <doi:10.1007/978-94-007-7596-1>,
    15 EQ-5D-5L EQ-VT value sets from the EuroQol website, and the EQ-5D-5L crosswalk
    value sets developed by van Hout et al. (2012)  <doi:10.1016/j.jval.2012.02.008>
    are included. Additionally, a shiny web tool is  included to enable the calculation
    and visualisation of EQ-5D index values via a  web browser using EQ-5D dimension
    scores stored in CSV or Excel files. '
