  summary: Operations on triangular meshes based on 'VCGLIB'. This package integrates nicely
    with the R-package 'rgl' to render the meshes processed by 'Rvcg'. The Visualization
    and Computer Graphics Library (VCG for short) is an open source portable C++ templated
    library for manipulation, processing and displaying with OpenGL of triangle and
    tetrahedral meshes. The library, composed by more than 100k lines of code, is released
    under the GPL license, and it is the base of most of the software tools of the Visual
    Computing Lab of the Italian National Research Council Institute ISTI <http://vcg.isti.cnr.it>,
    like 'metro' and 'MeshLab'. The 'VCGLIB' source is pulled from trunk <https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/vcglib>
    and patched to work with options determined by the configure script as well as to
    work with the header files included by 'RcppEigen'.
