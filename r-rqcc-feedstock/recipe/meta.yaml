  summary: Constructs various robust quality control charts based on the median or Hodges-Lehmann
    estimator (location) and the median absolute deviation (MAD) or Shamos estimator
    (scale). The estimators used for the robust control charts are all unbiased with
    a sample of finite size. For more details, see Park, Kim and Wang (2022) <doi:10.1080/03610918.2019.1699114>.
    In addition, using this R package, the conventional quality control charts such
    as X-bar, S, R, p, np, u, c, g, h, and t charts are also easily constructed. This
