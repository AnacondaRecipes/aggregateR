  summary: Evaluation of the pdf and the cdf of the univariate, noncentral, p-generalized normal
    distribution. Sampling from the univariate, noncentral, p-generalized normal distribution
    using either the p-generalized polar method, the p-generalized rejecting polar method,
    the Monty Python method, the Ziggurat method or the method of Nardon and Pianca.
    The package also includes routines for the simulation of the bivariate, p-generalized
    uniform distribution and the simulation of the corresponding angular distribution.
