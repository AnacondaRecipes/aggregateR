  summary: Provides functions to calculate the requisite sample size for studies where ICC is  the
    primary outcome. Can also be used for calculation of power. In both cases it allows
    the user to test the impact of changing input variables by calculating the outcome
    for several different values of input variables. Based off the work of Zou. Zou,
    G. Y. (2012). Sample size formulas for estimating intraclass correlation coefficients
    with precision and assurance. Statistics in medicine, 31(29), 3972-3981.
