  summary: Inference, goodness-of-fit test, and prediction densities and intervals for univariate
    Gaussian Hidden Markov Models (HMM). The goodness-of-fit is based on a Cramer-von
    Mises statistic and uses parametric bootstrap to estimate the p-value. The description
    of the methodology is taken from Chapter 10.2 of Remillard (2013) <doi:10.1201/b14285>.
