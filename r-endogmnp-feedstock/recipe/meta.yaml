  summary: endogMNP is an R package that fits a Bayesian multinomial probit model with endogenous
    selection, which is sometimes called an endogenous switching model.  This can be
    used to model discrete choice data when respondents select themselves into one of
    several groups.  This package is based on the MNP package by Kosuke Imai and David
    A. van Dyk.  This package modifies their code.
