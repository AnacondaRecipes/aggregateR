  summary: Computes the sample probability value (p-value) for the estimated coefficient from
    a standard genome-wide univariate regression.  It computes the exact finite-sample
    p-value under the assumption that the measured phenotype (the dependent variable
    in the regression) has a known Bernoulli-normal mixture distribution. Finite-sample
    genome-wide regression p-values (Gwrpv) with a non-normally distributed phenotype
    (Gregory Connor and Michael O'Neill, bioRxiv 204727 <doi:10.1101/204727>).
