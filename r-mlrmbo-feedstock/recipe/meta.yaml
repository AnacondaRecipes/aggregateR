  summary: Flexible and comprehensive R toolbox for model-based optimization ('MBO'), also known
    as Bayesian optimization. It implements the Efficient Global Optimization Algorithm
    and is designed for both single- and multi- objective optimization with mixed continuous,
    categorical and conditional parameters. The machine learning toolbox 'mlr' provide
    dozens of regression learners to model the performance of the target algorithm with
    respect to the parameter settings. It provides many different infill criteria to
    guide the search process. Additional features include multi-point batch proposal,
    parallel execution as well as visualization and sophisticated logging mechanisms,
    which is especially useful for teaching and understanding of algorithm behavior.
    'mlrMBO' is implemented in a modular fashion, such that single components can be
    easily replaced or adapted by the user for specific use cases.
