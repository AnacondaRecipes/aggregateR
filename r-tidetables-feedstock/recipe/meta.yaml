  summary: Tide analysis and prediction of predominantly semi-diurnal tides with two high waters
    and two low waters during one lunar day (~24.842 hours, ~1.035 days). The analysis
    should preferably cover an observation period of at least 19 years. For shorter
    periods, for example, the nodal cycle can not be taken into account, which particularly
    affects the height calculation. The main objective of this package is to produce
    tide tables.
