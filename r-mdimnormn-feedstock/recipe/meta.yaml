  summary: 'Normalize data to minimize the difference between sample plates  (batch effects).
    For given data in a matrix and grouping variable (or plate), the function ''normn_MA''
    normalizes the data on MA coordinates.  More details are in the citation. The primary
    method is ''Multi-MA''. Other  fitting functions on MA coordinates can also be employed
    e.g. loess.  '
