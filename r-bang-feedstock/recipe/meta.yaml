  summary: 'Provides functions for the Bayesian analysis of some simple commonly-used models,
    without using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods such as Gibbs sampling.  The
    ''rust'' package <https://cran.r-project.org/package=rust> is used to simulate a
    random sample from the required posterior distribution, using the generalized ratio-of-uniforms
    method.  See Wakefield, Gelfand and Smith (1991) <DOI:10.1007/BF01889987> for details.
    At the moment three conjugate hierarchical models are available: beta-binomial,
    gamma-Poisson and a 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).'
