  summary: 'This package clusters regression coefficients using the methods of clustering through
    linear regression models (CLM) (Qin and Self 2006). Maximum likelihood approach
    is used to infer the parameters for each cluster. Bayesian information criterion
    (BIC) combined with Bootstrapped maximum volume (BMV) criterion are used to determine
    the number of clusters. '
