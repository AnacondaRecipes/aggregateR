  summary: Provides an interface to pomdp-solve, a solver for Partially Observable Markov Decision
    Processes (POMDP). The package enables the user to simply define all components
    of a POMDP model and solve the problem using several methods. The package also contains
    functions to analyze and visualize the POMDP solutions (e.g., the optimal policy).
