  summary: 'Methods for estimation and hypothesis testing of proportions in group testing designs:
    methods for estimating a proportion in a single population (assuming sensitivity
    and specificity equal to 1 in designs with equal group sizes), as well as hypothesis
    tests and functions for experimental design for this situation. For estimating one
    proportion or the difference of proportions, a number of confidence interval methods
    are included, which can deal with various different pool sizes. Further, regression
    methods are implemented for simple pooling and matrix pooling designs. Methods for
    identification of positive items in group testing designs: Optimal testing configurations
    can be found for hierarchical and array-based algorithms. Operating characteristics
    can be calculated for testing configurations across a wide variety of situations.'
