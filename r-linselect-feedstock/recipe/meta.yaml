  summary: Estimate the mean of a Gaussian vector, by choosing among a large collection of estimators,
    following the method developed by Y. Baraud, C. Giraud and S. Huet (2014) <doi:10.1214/13-AIHP539>.
    In particular it solves the problem of variable selection by choosing the best predictor
    among predictors emanating from different methods as lasso, elastic-net, adaptive
    lasso, pls, randomForest. Moreover, it can be applied for choosing the tuning parameter
    in a Gauss-lasso procedure.
