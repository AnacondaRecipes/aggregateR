  summary: Adds support for R startup configuration via '.Renviron.d' and '.Rprofile.d' directories
    in addition to '.Renviron' and '.Rprofile' files.  This makes it possible to keep
    private / secret environment variables separate from other environment variables.  It
    also makes it easier to share specific startup settings by simply copying a file
    to a directory.
