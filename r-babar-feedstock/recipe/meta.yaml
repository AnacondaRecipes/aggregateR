  summary: Babar is designed to use nested sampling (a Bayesian analysis technique) to compare
    possible models for bacterial growth curves, as well as extracting parameters. It
    allows model evidence and parameter likelihood values to be extracted, and also
    contains helper functions for comparing distributions as well as direct access to
    the underlying nested sampling code.
