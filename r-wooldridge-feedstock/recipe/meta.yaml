  summary: 'Students learning both econometrics and R may find the introduction  to both challenging.
    However, if the text is "Introductory Econometrics:  A Modern Approach" by Jeffrey
    M. Wooldridge, they are in luck!  The wooldridge data package aims to lighten the
    task by efficiently loading  any data set found in the text with a single command.
    Data sets have all been  compressed to a fraction of their original size and are
    well documented.  Documentation files contain the page numbers of the text where
    each set is used,  the original source, time of publication, and notes suggesting
    ideas for further  exploratory data analysis and research. If one need''s to brush-up
    on model syntax, a  vignette contains R solutions to examples from each chapter
    of the text.  Data sets are from the 6th edition (Wooldridge 2016, ISBN-13: 978-1-305-27010-7),  and
    are backwards compatible with all versions of the text.'
