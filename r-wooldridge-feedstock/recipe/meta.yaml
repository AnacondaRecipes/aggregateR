  summary: Students learning both econometrics and R may find the introduction to both challenging.
    The wooldridge data package aims to lighten the task by efficiently loading any
    data set found in the text with a single command. Data sets have been compressed
    to a fraction of their original size. Documentation files contain page numbers,
    the original source, time of publication, and notes from the author suggesting avenues
    for further analysis and research. If one needs an introduction to R model syntax,
    a vignette contains solutions to examples from chapters of the text. Data sets are
    from the 7th edition (Wooldridge 2020, ISBN-13 978-1-337-55886-0), and are backwards
    compatible with all previous versions of the text.
