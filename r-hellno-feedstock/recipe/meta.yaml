  summary: Base R's default setting for 'stringsAsFactors' within 'data.frame()' and 'as.data.frame()'
    is supposedly the most often complained about piece of code in the R infrastructure.
    The 'hellno' package provides an explicit solution without changing R itself or
    having to mess around with options. It tries to solve this problem by providing
    alternative 'data.frame()' and 'as.data.frame()' functions that are in fact simple
    wrappers around base R's 'data.frame()' and 'as.data.frame()' with 'stringsAsFactors'
    option set to 'HELLNO' ( which in turn equals FALSE ) by default.
