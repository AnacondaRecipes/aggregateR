  summary: 'Set of tools to the statistical analysis of data using: (1) normal linear models;
    (2) generalized linear models; (3) negative binomial regression models as alternative
    to the Poisson regression models under the presence of overdispersion; (4) beta-binomial
    and random-clumped binomial regression models as alternative to the binomial regression
    models under the presence of overdispersion; (5) Zero-inflated and zero-altered
    regression models to deal with zero-excess in count data; (6) generalized estimating
    equations for cluster correlated data.'
