  summary: Provides classes for storing and manipulating taxonomic data. Most of the classes
    can be treated like base R vectors (e.g. can be used in tables as columns and can
    be named). Vectorized classes can store taxon names and authorities, taxon IDs from
    databases, taxon ranks, and other types of information. More complex classes are
    provided to store taxonomic trees and user-defined data associated with them.
