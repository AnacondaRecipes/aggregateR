  summary: 'Implements random  number generation, plotting, and estimation algorithms for the
    two-parameter one-sided and two-sided M-Wright (Mainardi-Wright) family. The M-Wright  distributions
    naturally generalize the widely used one-sided (Airy and half-normal or half-Gaussian)
    and symmetric (Airy and Gaussian or normal) models.  These are widely studied in
    time-fractional differential equations. References: Cahoy and Minkabo (2017) <doi:10.3233/MAS-170388>;
