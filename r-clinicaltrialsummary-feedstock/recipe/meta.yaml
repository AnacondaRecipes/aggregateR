  summary: Provides estimates of several summary measures for clinical trials including the average
    hazard ratio, the weighted average hazard ratio, the restricted  superiority probability
    ratio, the restricted mean survival difference and  the ratio of restricted mean
    times lost, based on the short-term and  long-term hazard ratio model (Yang, 2005
    <doi:10.1093/biomet/92.1.1>)  which accommodates various non-proportional hazards
    scenarios. The inference procedures and the asymptotic results for the summary measures
    are discussed  in Yang (2018, <doi:10.1002/sim.7676>).
