  summary: 'A robust backfitting algorithm for additive models based on (robust) local polynomial  kernel
    smoothers. It includes both bounded and re-descending (kernel) M-estimators, and
    it computes predictions for points outside the training set if desired. See Boente,
    Martinez and Salibian-Barrera (2017) <doi:10.1080/10485252.2017.1369077> for details. '
