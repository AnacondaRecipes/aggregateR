  summary: Package for processing downloaded MODIS Calibrated radiances Product HDF files. Specifically,
    MOD02 calibrated radiance product files, and the associated MOD03 geolocation files
    (for MODIS-TERRA). The package will be most effective if the user installs MRTSwath
    (MODIS Reprojection Tool for swath products; <https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/tools/modis_reprojection_tool_swath>,
    and adds the directory with the MRTSwath executable to the default R PATH by editing
    ~/.Rprofile.
