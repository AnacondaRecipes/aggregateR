  summary: Data package for 'dartR'. Provides data sets to run examples in 'dartR'. This was
    necessary due to the size limit imposed by 'CRAN'. The data in 'dartR.data' is needed
    to run the examples provided in the 'dartR' functions. All available data sets are
    either based on actual data (but reduced in size) and/or simulated data sets to
    allow the fast execution of examples and demonstration of the functions.
