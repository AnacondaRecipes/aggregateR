  summary: 'R interface to DSDP semidefinite programming library. The DSDP software is a free
    open source implementation of an interior-point method for semidefinite programming.
    It provides primal and dual solutions, exploits low-rank structure and sparsity
    in the data, and has relatively low memory requirements for an interior-point method. '
