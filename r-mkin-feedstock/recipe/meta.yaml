  summary: 'Calculation routines based on the FOCUS Kinetics Report (2006, 2014).  Includes a
    function for conveniently defining differential equation models, model solution
    based on eigenvalues if possible or using numerical solvers.  If a C compiler (on
    windows: ''Rtools'') is installed, differential equation models are solved using
    automatically generated C functions. Heteroscedasticity can be taken into account
    using variance by variable or two-component error models as described by Ranke and
    Meinecke (2018) <doi:10.3390/environments6120124>.  Hierarchical degradation models
    can be fitted using nonlinear mixed-effects model packages as a back end as described
    by Ranke et al. (2021) <doi:10.3390/environments8080071>.  Please note that no warranty
    is implied for correctness of results or fitness for a particular purpose.'
