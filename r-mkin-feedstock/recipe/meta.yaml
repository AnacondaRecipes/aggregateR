  summary: 'Calculation routines based on the FOCUS Kinetics Report (2006, 2014).  Includes a
    function for conveniently defining differential equation models, model solution
    based on eigenvalues if possible or using numerical solvers and a choice of the
    optimisation methods made available by the ''FME'' package.  If a C compiler (on
    windows: ''Rtools'') is installed, differential equation models are solved using
    compiled C functions.  Please note that no warranty is implied for correctness of
    results or fitness for a particular purpose.'
