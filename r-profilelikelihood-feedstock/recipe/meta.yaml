  summary: Provides profile likelihoods for a parameter of interest in commonly used statistical
    models. The models include linear models, generalized linear models, proportional
    odds models, linear mixed-effects models, and linear models for longitudinal responses
    fitted by generalized least squares. The package also provides plots for normalized
    profile likelihoods as well as the maximum profile likelihood estimates and the
    kth likelihood support intervals.
