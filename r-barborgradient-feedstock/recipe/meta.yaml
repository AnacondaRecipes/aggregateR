  summary: Tool to find where a function has its lowest value(minimum). The functions can be
    any dimensions. Recommended use is with eps=10^-10, but can be run with 10^-20,
    although this depends on the function. Two more methods are in this package, simple
    gradient method (Gradmod) and Powell method (Powell). These are not recommended
    for use, their purpose are purely for comparison.
