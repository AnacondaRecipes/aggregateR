  summary: Provides a generalized method for printing tabular data within the R environment in
    order to make the process of presenting high quality tabular output seamless for
    the user.  Output is directed to the R graphics device so that tables can be exported
    to any file format supported by the graphics device. Utilizes a formula interface
    to specify the contents of tables often found in manuscripts or business reports.  In
    addition, formula interface provides inline formatting of the numeric cells of a
    table and renaming column labels.
