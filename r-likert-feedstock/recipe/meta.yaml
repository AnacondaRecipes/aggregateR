  summary: An approach to analyzing Likert response items, with an emphasis on visualizations.
    The stacked bar plot is the preferred method for presenting Likert results. Tabular
    results are also implemented along with density plots to assist researchers in determining
    whether Likert responses can be used quantitatively instead of qualitatively. See
    the likert(), summary.likert(), and plot.likert() functions to get started.
