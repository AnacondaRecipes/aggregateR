  summary: This package provides utilities to calculate the probabilities of various dice-rolling
    events, such as the probability of rolling a four-sided die six times and getting
    a 4, a 3, and either a 1 or 2 among the six rolls (in any order); the probability
    of rolling two six-sided dice three times and getting a 10 on the first roll, followed
    by a 4 on the second roll, followed by anything but a 7 on the third roll; or the
    probabilities of each possible sum of rolling five six-sided dice, dropping the
    lowest two rolls, and summing the remaining dice.
