  summary: 'The caroline R library contains dozens of functions useful for: database migration
    (dbWriteTable2), database style joins & aggregation (nerge, groupBy & bestBy), data
    structure conversion (nv, tab2df), legend table making (sstable & leghead), plot
    annotation (labsegs & mvlabs), data visualization (violins, pies & raPlot), character
    string manipulation (m & pad), file I/O (write.delim), batch scripting and more.  The
    package''s greatest contributions lie in the database style merge, aggregation and
    interface functions as well as in it''s extensive use and propagation of row, column
    and vector names in most functions.'
