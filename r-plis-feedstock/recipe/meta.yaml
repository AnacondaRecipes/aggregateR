  summary: A multiple testing procedure for testing several groups of hypotheses is implemented.
    Linear dependency among the hypotheses within the same group is modeled by using
    hidden Markov Models. It is noted that a smaller p value does not necessarily imply
    more significance due to the dependency. A typical application is to analyze genome
    wide association studies datasets, where SNPs from the same chromosome are treated
    as a group and exhibit strong linear genomic dependency. See Wei Z, Sun W, Wang
    K, Hakonarson H (2009) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btp476> for more details.
