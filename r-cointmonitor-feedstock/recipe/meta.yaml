  summary: We propose a consistent monitoring procedure to detect a structural change from a
    cointegrating relationship to a spurious relationship. The procedure is based on
    residuals from modified least squares estimation, using either Fully Modified, Dynamic
    or Integrated Modified OLS. It is inspired by Chu et al. (1996) <DOI:10.2307/2171955>
    in that it is based on parameter estimation on a pre-break "calibration" period
    only, rather than being based on sequential estimation over the full sample. See
    the discussion paper <DOI:10.2139/ssrn.2624657> for further information. This package
    provides the monitoring procedures for both the cointegration and the stationarity
    case (while the latter is just a special case of the former one) as well as printing
    and plotting methods for a clear presentation of the results.
