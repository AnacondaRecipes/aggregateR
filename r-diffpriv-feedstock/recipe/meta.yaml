  summary: An implementation of major general-purpose mechanisms for privatizing statistics,
    models, and machine learners, within the framework of differential privacy of Dwork
    et al. (2006) <doi:10.1007/11681878_14>. Example mechanisms include the Laplace
    mechanism for releasing numeric aggregates, and the  exponential mechanism for releasing
    set elements. A sensitivity sampler  (Rubinstein & Alda, 2017) <arXiv:1706.02562>
    permits sampling target  non-private function sensitivity; combined with the generic
    mechanisms, it  permits turn-key privatization of arbitrary programs.
