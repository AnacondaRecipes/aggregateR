  summary: Provides the ability to create dynamic citations in which the bibliographic information
    is pulled from the web rather than having to be entered into a local database such
    as 'bibtex' ahead of time. The package is primarily aimed at authoring in the R
    'markdown' format, and can provide outputs for web-based authoring such as linked
    text for inline citations.  Cite using a 'DOI', URL, or 'bibtex' file key.  See
    the package URL for details.
