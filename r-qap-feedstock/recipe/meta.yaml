  summary: Implements heuristics for the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP). Although, the QAP
    was introduced as a combinatorial optimization problem for the facility location
    problem in operations research, it also has many applications in data analysis.
    The problem is NP-hard and the package implements a simulated annealing heuristic.
