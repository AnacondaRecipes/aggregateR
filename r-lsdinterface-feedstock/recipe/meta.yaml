  summary: Interfaces R with LSD. Reads object-oriented data in results files (.res) produced
    by LSD and creates appropriate multi-dimensional arrays in R. Supports multiple
    core parallelization of multi-file data reading for increased performance. Also
    provides functions to extract basic information and statistics from data files.
    LSD (Laboratory for Simulation Development) is free software developed by Marco
    Valente (documentation and downloads available at <http://labsimdev.org>).
