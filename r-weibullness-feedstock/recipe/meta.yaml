  summary: Performs a goodness-of-fit test of Weibull distribution (weibullness test) and provides
    the maximum likelihood estimates of the three-parameter Weibull distribution. Note
    that the threshold parameter is estimated based on the correlation from the Weibull
    plot. For more details, see Park (2018) <doi:10.1155/2018/6056975>. This work was
    supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the
    Korea government (No. NRF-2017R1A2B4004169).
