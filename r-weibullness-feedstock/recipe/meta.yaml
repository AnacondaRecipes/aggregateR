  summary: Performs a goodness-of-fit test for Weibull distribution (weibullness test) and provides
    the parameter estimates of the two- and three-parameter Weibull distributions. Note
    that the threshold parameter is estimated based on the correlation from the Weibull
    plot. For more details, see <doi:10.23055/ijietap.2017.24.4.2848>, <doi:10.1155/2018/6056975>,
