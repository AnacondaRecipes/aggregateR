  summary: This package provides statistical inference tools applied to Partial Linear Regression
    (PLR) models. Specifically, point estimation, confidence intervals estimation, bandwidth
    selection, goodness-of-fit tests and analysis of covariance are considered.  Kernel-based
    methods, combined with ordinary least squares estimation, are used and time series  errors
    are allowed. In addition, these techniques are also implemented for both parametric
    (linear)  and nonparametric regression models.
