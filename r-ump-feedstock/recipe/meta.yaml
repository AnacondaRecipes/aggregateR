  summary: Does uniformly most powerful (UMP) and uniformly most powerful unbiased (UMPU) tests.  At
    present only distribution implemented is binomial distribution.  Also does fuzzy
    tests and confidence intervals (following Geyer and Meeden, 2005, <doi:10.1214/088342305000000340>)
    for the binomial distribution (one-tailed procedures based on UMP test and two-tailed
    procedures based on UMPU test).
