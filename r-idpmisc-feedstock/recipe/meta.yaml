  summary: 'Different high-level graphics functions for displaying large datasets, displaying
    circular data in a very flexible way, finding local maxima, brewing color ramps,
    drawing nice arrows, zooming 2D-plots, creating figures with differently colored
    margin and plot region.  In addition, the package contains auxiliary functions for
    data manipulation like omitting observations with irregular values or selecting
    data by logical vectors, which include NAs. Other functions are especially useful
    in spectroscopy and analyses of environmental data: robust baseline fitting, finding
    peaks in spectra, converting humidity measures.'
