  summary: Bayesian networks provide an intuitive framework for probabilistic reasoning and its
    graphical nature can be interpreted quite clearly. Graph based methods of machine
    learning are becoming more popular because they offer a richer model of knowledge
    that can be understood by a human in a graphical format. The 'bnviewer' is an R
    Package that allows the interactive visualization of Bayesian Networks. The aim
    of this package is to improve the Bayesian Networks visualization over the basic
    and static views offered by existing packages.
