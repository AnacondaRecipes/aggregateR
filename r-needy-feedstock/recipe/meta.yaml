  summary: needy is a small utility library designed to make testing function inputs less difficult.
    R is a dynamically typed language, but larger projects need input checking for scalabity.
    needy offers a single function, require_a( ), which lets you specify the traits
    an input object should have, such as class, size, numerical properties or number
    of parameters, while reducing boilerplate code and aiding debugging.
