  summary: An implementation of extensions to Freund and Schapire's AdaBoost  algorithm and Friedman's
    gradient boosting machine. Includes regression  methods for least squares, absolute
    loss, t-distribution loss, quantile  regression, logistic, multinomial logistic,
    Poisson, Cox proportional hazards  partial likelihood, AdaBoost exponential loss,
    Huberized hinge loss, and  Learning to Rank measures (LambdaMart). Originally developed
    by Greg Ridgeway.
