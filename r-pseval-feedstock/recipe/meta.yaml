  license: MIT
  summary: Contains the core methods for the evaluation of principal surrogates in a single clinical
    trial. Provides a flexible interface for defining models for the risk given treatment
    and the surrogate, the models for integration over the missing counterfactual surrogate
    responses, and the estimation methods. Estimated maximum likelihood and pseudo-score
    can be used for estimation, and the bootstrap for inference. A variety of post-estimation
    summary methods are provided, including print, summary, plot, and testing.
