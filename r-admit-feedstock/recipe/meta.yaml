  summary: 'Provides functions to perform the fitting of an adaptive mixture of Student-t distributions
    to a target density through its kernel function as described in Ardia et al. (2009)
    <doi:10.18637/jss.v029.i03>. The mixture approximation can then be used as the importance
    density in importance sampling or as the candidate density in the Metropolis-Hastings
    algorithm to obtain quantities of interest for the target density itself. '
