  summary: 'An implementation of routines for solving rate-distortion problems. Rate-distortion
    theory is a field within information theory that examines optimal lossy compression.
    That is, given that some information must be lost, how can a communication channel
    be designed that minimizes the cost of communication error? Rate-distortion theory
    is concerned with the optimal  (minimal cost) solution to such tradeoffs. An important
    tool for solving rate-distortion problems is the Blahut algorithm, developed by
    Richard Blahut and described in: . Blahut, R. E. (1972). Computation of channel
    capacity and rate-distortion functions. IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,
    IT-18(4), 460-473. . This package implements the basic Blahut algorithm, and additionally
    contains a number of `helper'' functions, including a routine for searching for
    an information channel that minimizes cost subject to a constraint on information
    rate.'
