  summary: 'Imputing blockwise missing data by imprecise imputation, featuring a domain-based,
    variable-wise, and case-wise strategy. Furthermore, the estimation of lower and
    upper bounds for unconditional and conditional probabilities based on the obtained
    imprecise data is implemented. Additionally, two utility functions are supplied:
    one to check whether variables in a data set contain set-valued observations; and
    another to merge two already imprecisely imputed data. The method is described in
    a technical report by Endres, Fink and Augustin (2018, <doi:10.5282/ubm/epub.42423>).'
