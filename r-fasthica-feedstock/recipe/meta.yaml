  summary: It implements HICA (Hierarchical Independent Component Analysis) algorithm. This approach,
    obtained through the integration between treelets and Independent Component Analysis,
    is able to provide a multi-scale non-orthogonal data-driven basis, whose elements
    have a phenomenological interpretation according to the problem under study.
