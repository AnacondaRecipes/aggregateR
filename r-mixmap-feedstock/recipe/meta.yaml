  summary: A collection of functions to implement the MixMAP algorithm, which performs gene level
    tests of association using data from a previous GWAS or data from a meta-analysis
    of several GWAS.  Conceptually, genes are detected as significant if the collection
    of p-values within a gene are determined to be collectively smaller than would be
    observed by chance.
