  summary: 'The expression of X-chromosome undergoes three possible biological processes: X-chromosome
    inactivation (XCI), escape of the X-chromosome inactivation (XCI-E),and skewed X-chromosome
    inactivation (XCI-S). To analyze the X-linked genetic association for phenotype
    such as continuous, binary, and time-to-event outcomes with the actual process unknown,
    we propose a unified approach of maximizing the likelihood or partial likelihood
    over all of the potential biological processes. The methods are described in Wei
    Xu, Meiling Hao (2017) <doi:10.1002/gepi.22097>. And also see Dongxiao Han, Meiling
