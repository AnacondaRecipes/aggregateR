  summary: Software for genomic prediction with the RR-BLUP mixed model (Endelman 2011, <doi:10.3835/plantgenome2011.08.0024>).
    One application is to estimate marker effects by ridge regression; alternatively,
    BLUPs can be calculated based on an additive relationship matrix or a Gaussian kernel.
