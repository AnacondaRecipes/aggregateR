  summary: Provides pre-fit and post-fit methods for detecting separation and infinite maximum
    likelihood estimates in generalized linear models with categorical responses. The
    pre-fit methods apply on binomial-response generalized liner models such as logit,
    probit and cloglog regression, and can be directly supplied as fitting methods to
    the glm() function. They solve the linear programming problems for the detection
    of separation developed in Konis (2007, <https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:8f9ee0d0-d78e-4101-9ab4-f9cbceed2a2a>)
    using 'ROI' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=ROI> or 'lpSolveAPI' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=lpSolveAPI>.
    The post-fit methods apply to models with categorical responses, including binomial-response
    generalized linear models and multinomial-response models, such as baseline category
    logits and adjacent category logits models; for example, the models implemented
    in the 'brglm2' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=brglm2> package. The post-fit
    methods successively refit the model with increasing number of iteratively reweighted
    least squares iterations, and monitor the ratio of the estimated standard error
    for each parameter to what it has been in the first iteration. According to the
    results in Lesaffre & Albert (1989, <https://www.jstor.org/stable/2345845>), divergence
    of those ratios indicates data separation.
