  summary: Provides several helper functions for working with 'knitr' and 'LaTeX'. It includes
    'xTab' for creating traditional 'LaTeX' tables, 'lTab' for generating 'longtable'
    environments, and 'sTab' for generating a 'supertabular' environment. Additionally,
    this package contains a knitr_setup() function which fixes a well-known bug in 'knitr',
    which distorts the 'results="asis"' command when used in conjunction with user-defined
    commands; and a com command (<<com=TRUE>>=) which renders the output from 'knitr'
    as a 'LaTeX' command.
