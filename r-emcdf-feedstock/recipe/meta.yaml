  summary: Computes and visualizes empirical joint distribution of multivariate data with optimized
    algorithms and multi-thread computation. There is a faster algorithm using dynamic
    programming to compute the whole empirical joint distribution of a bivariate data.
    There are optimized algorithms for computing empirical joint CDF function values
    for other multivariate data. Visualization is focused on bivariate data. Levelplots
    and wireframes are included.
