  summary: This is the implementation in R+C of a new association test described in "A fast,
    unbiased and exact allelic exact test for case-control association studies" (Submitted).  It
    appears that in most cases the classical chi-square test used for testing for allelic
    association on genotype data is biased. Our test is unbiased, exact but fast throught
    careful optimization.
