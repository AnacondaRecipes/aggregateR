  summary: Functions for loading large (10M+ lines) CSV and other delimited files, similar to
    read.csv, but typically faster and using less memory than the standard R loader.
    While not entirely general, it covers many common use cases when the types of columns
    in the CSV file are known in advance. In addition, the package provides a class
    'int64', which represents 64-bit integers exactly when reading from a file. The
    latter is useful when working with 64-bit integer identifiers exported from databases.
    The CSV file loader supports common column types including 'integer', 'double',
    'string', and 'int64', leaving further type transformations  to the user.
