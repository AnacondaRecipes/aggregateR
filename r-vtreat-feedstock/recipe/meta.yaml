  summary: 'A ''data.frame'' processor/conditioner that prepares real-world data for predictive
    modeling in a statistically sound manner. ''vtreat'' prepares variables so that
    data has fewer exceptional cases, making it easier to safely use models in production.
    Common problems ''vtreat'' defends against: ''Inf'', ''NA'', too many categorical
    levels, rare categorical levels, and new categorical levels (levels seen during
    application, but not during training). Reference: "''vtreat'': a data.frame Processor
    for Predictive Modeling", Zumel, Mount, 2016, <DOI:10.5281/zenodo.1173313>.'
