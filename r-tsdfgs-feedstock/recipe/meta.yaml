  summary: Determining training set for genomic selection using a genetic algorithm (Holland
    J.H. (1975) <DOI:10.1145/1216504.1216510>) or simple exchange algorithm (change
    an individual every iteration). Three different criteria are used in both algorithms,
    which are r-score (Ou J.H., Liao C.T. (2018) <DOI:10.6342/NTU201802290>), PEV-score
    (Akdemir D. et al. (2015) <DOI:10.1186/s12711-015-0116-6>) and CD-score (Laloe D.
    (1993) <DOI:10.1186/1297-9686-25-6-557>). Phenotypic data for candidate set is not
    necessary for all these methods. By using it, one may readily determine a training
    set that can be expected to provide a better training set comparing to random sampling.
