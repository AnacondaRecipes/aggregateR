  summary: 'Filter CpGs based on Intra-class Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) when replicates
    are available. ICCs are calculated by fitting linear mixed effects models to all
    samples including the un-replicated samples. Including the large number of un-replicated
    samples improves ICC estimates dramatically. The method accommodates any replicate
    design. '
