  summary: 'Aim: Adjust the graphical parameters to create nicer longitudinal series plots. The
    default set of graphical parameters is very general, and can be improved upon when
    we are interested in plotting data points observed over time. Functions facilitate
    plotting those kind of series, univariate plots, bivariate plots (with vertical
    axis on both left and right hand sides), multivariate plots and plots which allow
    to examine whether a new observation is ''unusual'' via construction and visualization
    of prediction intervals around it.'
