  summary: A wrapper around Michel Scheffers's 'libassp' (<https://libassp.sourceforge.net/>).
    The 'libassp' (Advanced Speech Signal Processor) library aims at providing functionality
    for handling speech signal files in most common audio formats and for performing
    analyses common in phonetic science/speech science. This includes the calculation
    of formants, fundamental frequency, root mean square, auto correlation, a variety
    of spectral analyses, zero crossing rate, filtering etc. This wrapper provides R
    with a large subset of 'libassp's signal processing functions and provides them
    to the user in a (hopefully) user-friendly manner.
