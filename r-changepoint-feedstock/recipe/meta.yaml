  summary: Implements various mainstream and specialised changepoint methods for finding single
    and multiple changepoints within data.  Many popular non-parametric and frequentist
    methods are included.  The cpt.mean(), cpt.var(), cpt.meanvar() functions should
    be your first point of call.
