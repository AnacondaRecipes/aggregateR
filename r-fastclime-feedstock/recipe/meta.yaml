  summary: Provides a method of recovering the precision matrix efficiently and solving for the
    dantzig selector by applying the parametric simplex method.  The computation is
    based on a linear optimization solver. It also contains a generic LP solver and
    a parameterized LP solver using parametric simplex method.
