  summary: Density, distribution, quantile and hazard functions of a stable variate; generalized
    regression models for the parameters of a stable distribution. See the README for
    how to make equivalent calls to those of 'stabledist' (i.e., Nolan's 0-parameterization
    and 1-parameterization as detailed in Nolan (2020)). See github for Lambert and
    Lindsey 1999 JRSS-C journal article, which details the parameterization of the Buck
    (1995) stable. See the Details section of the `?dstable` help file for context and
    references.
