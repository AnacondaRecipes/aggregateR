  summary: Create adjacency matrices of vocalisation graphs from dataframes containing sequences
    of speech and silence intervals, transforming these matrices into Markov diagrams,
    and generating datasets for classification of these diagrams by 'flattening' them
    and adding global properties (functionals) etc.  Vocalisation diagrams date back
    to early work in psychiatry (Jaffe and Feldstein, 1970) and social psychology (Dabbs
    and Ruback, 1987) but have only recently been employed as a data representation
    method for machine learning tasks including meeting segmentation (Luz, 2012) <doi:10.1145/2328967.2328970>
    and classification (Luz, 2013) <doi:10.1145/2522848.2533788>.
