  summary: A graphical tool designed to visualize and to give an overview of behavioral observations
    realized on individuals or groups. Visualization of raw data during experimental
    observations of the realization of a procedure. It graphically presents an overview
    of individuals and group actions usually acquired from timestamps during video recorded
    sessions. Options of the package allow adding graphical information as statistical
    indicators (mean, standard deviation, quantile or statistical test) but also for
    each action green or black zones providing visual information about the accuracy
    of the realized actions.
