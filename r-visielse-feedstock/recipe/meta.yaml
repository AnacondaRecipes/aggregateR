  summary: A graphical R package designed to visualize behavioral observations over time. Based
    on raw time data extracted from video recorded sessions of experimental observations,
    ViSiElse grants a global overview of a process by combining the visualization of
    multiple actions timestamps for all participants in a single graph. Individuals
    and/or group behavior can easily be assessed. Supplementary features allow users
    to further inspect their data by adding summary statistics (mean, standard deviation,
    quantile or statistical test) and/or time constraints to assess the accuracy of
    the realized actions.
