  summary: Performs general Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling of a user defined
    function which returns the un-normalized value (likelihood times prior) of a Bayesian
    model.  The proposal variance-covariance structure is updated adaptively for efficient
    mixing when the structure of the target distribution is unknown.  The package also
    provides some functions for Bayesian inference including Bayesian Credible Intervals
    (BCI) and Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) calculation.
