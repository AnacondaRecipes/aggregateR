  summary: Climate stability measures are not formalized in the literature and tools for generating
    stability metrics from existing data are nascent. This package provides tools for
    calculating climate stability from raster data encapsulating climate change as a
    series of time slices. The methods follow Owens and Guralnick. Submitted, Biodiversity
    Informatics.
