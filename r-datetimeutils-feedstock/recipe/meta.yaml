  summary: Utilities for handling dates and times, such as selecting particular days of the week
    or month, formatting timestamps as required by RSS feeds, or converting timestamp
    representations of other software (such as 'MATLAB' and 'Excel') to R. The package
    is lightweight (no dependencies, pure R implementations) and relies only on R's
    standard classes to represent dates and times ('Date' and 'POSIXt'); it aims to
    provide efficient implementations, through vectorisation and the use of R's native
    numeric representations of timestamps where possible.
