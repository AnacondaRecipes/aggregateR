  summary: Allow users to obtain clean and tidy football (soccer) game, team and player data.
    Data is collected from a number of popular sites, including 'FBref', transfer and
    valuations data from 'Transfermarkt'<https://www.transfermarkt.com/> and shooting
    location and other match stats data from 'Understat'<https://understat.com/> and
    'fotmob'<https://www.fotmob.com/>. It gives users the ability to access data more
    efficiently, rather than having to export data tables to files before being able
    to complete their analysis.
