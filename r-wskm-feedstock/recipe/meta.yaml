  summary: Entropy weighted k-means (ewkm) is a weighted subspace clustering algorithm that is
    well suited to very high dimensional data. Weights are calculated as the importance
    of a variable with regard to cluster membership.  The two-level variable weighting
    clustering algorithm tw-k-means (twkm) introduces two types of weights, the weights
    on individual variables and the weights on variable groups, and they are calculated
    during the clustering process.  The feature group weighted k-means (fgkm) extends
    this concept by grouping features and weighting the group in addition to weighting
    individual features.
