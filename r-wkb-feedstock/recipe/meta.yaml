  summary: Utility functions to convert between the 'Spatial' classes specified by the package
    'sp', and the well-known binary '(WKB)' representation for geometry specified by
    the 'Open Geospatial Consortium'. Supports 'Spatial' objects of class 'SpatialPoints',
    'SpatialPointsDataFrame', 'SpatialLines', 'SpatialLinesDataFrame', 'SpatialPolygons',
    and 'SpatialPolygonsDataFrame'. Supports 'WKB' geometry types 'Point', 'LineString',
    'Polygon', 'MultiPoint', 'MultiLineString', and 'MultiPolygon'. Includes extensions
    to enable creation of maps with 'TIBCO Spotfire'.
