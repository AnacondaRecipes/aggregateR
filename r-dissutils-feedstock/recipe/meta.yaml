  summary: This package has extensible C++ code for computing dissimilarities between vectors.
    It also has a number of C++ functions for assembling collections of dissimilarities.
    In particular, it lets you find a matrix of dissimilarities between the rows of
    two input matrices. There are also functions for finding the nearest neighbors of
    each row of a matrix, either within the matrix itself or within another matrix.
