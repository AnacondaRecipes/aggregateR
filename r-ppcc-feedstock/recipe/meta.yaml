  summary: 'Calculates the Probability Plot Correlation Coefficient (PPCC) between a continuous
    variable X and a specified distribution. The corresponding composite hypothesis
    test that was first introduced by Filliben (1975) <doi: 10.1080/00401706.1975.10489279>
    can be performed to test whether the sample X is element of either the Normal, log-Normal,
    Exponential, Uniform, Cauchy, Logistic, Generalized Logistic, Gumbel (GEVI), Weibull,
    Generalized Extreme Value, Pearson III (Gamma 2), Mielke''s Kappa, Rayleigh or Generalized
    Logistic Distribution. The PPCC test is performed with a fast Monte-Carlo simulation.'
