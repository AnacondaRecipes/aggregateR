  summary: Regression methods to quantify the relation between two measurement methods. In particular
    it addresses regression problems with errors in both variables and without repeated
    measurements. The package provides implementations of Deming regression, weighted
    Deming regression, and Passing-Bablok regression following the CLSI EP09-A3 recommendations
    for analytical method comparison and bias estimation using patient samples.
