  summary: 'This package provides regression methods to quantify the relation between two measurement
    methods. In particular it addresses regression problems with errors in both variables
    and without repeated measurements. The package provides implementations of Deming
    regression, weighted Deming regression, and Passing-Bablok regression following
    the CLSI EP09-A3 recommendations for analytical method comparison and bias estimation
    using patient samples. '
