  summary: This function takes a vector or matrix of data and smooths the data with an improved
    Savitzky Golay transform. The Savitzky-Golay method for data smoothing and differentiation
    calculates convolution weights using Gram polynomials that exactly reproduce the
    results of least-squares polynomial regression. Use of the Savitzky-Golay method
    requires specification of both filter length and polynomial degree to calculate
    convolution weights. For maximum smoothing of statistical noise in data, polynomials
    with low degrees are desirable, while a high polynomial degree is necessary for
    accurate reproduction of peaks in the data. Extension of the least-squares regression
    formalism with statistical testing of additional terms of polynomial degree to a
    heuristically chosen minimum for each data window leads to an adaptive-degree polynomial
    filter (ADPF). Based on noise reduction for data that consist of pure noise and
    on signal reproduction for data that is purely signal, ADPF performed nearly as
    well as the optimally chosen fixed-degree Savitzky-Golay filter and outperformed
    sub-optimally chosen Savitzky-Golay filters. For synthetic data consisting of noise
    and signal, ADPF outperformed both optimally chosen and sub-optimally chosen fixed-degree
    Savitzky-Golay filters. See Barak, P. (1995) <doi:10.1021/ac00113a006> for more
    information.
