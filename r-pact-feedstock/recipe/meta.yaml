  summary: A prediction-based approach to the analysis of data from randomized clinical trials
    is implemented. Based on response and covariate data from a randomized clinical
    trial comparing a new experimental treatment E versus a control C, the objective
    is to develop and internally validate a model that can identify subjects likely
    to benefit from E rather than C. Currently, survival and binary response types are
    permitted.
