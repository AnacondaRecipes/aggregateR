  summary: A d-statistic tests the null hypothesis of no treatment effect in a matched, nonrandomized
    study of the effects caused by treatments.  A d-statistic focuses on subsets of
    matched pairs that demonstrate insensitivity to unmeasured bias in such an observational
    study, correcting for double-use of the data by conditional inference. This conditional
    inference can, in favorable circumstances, substantially increase the power of a
    sensitivity analysis (Rosenbaum (2010) <doi:10.1007/978-1-4419-1213-8_14>).  There
    are two examples, one concerning unemployment from Lalive et al. (2006) <doi:10.1111/j.1467-937X.2006.00406.x>,
    the other concerning smoking and periodontal disease from Rosenbaum (2017) <doi:10.1214/17-STS621>.
