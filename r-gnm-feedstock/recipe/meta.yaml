  summary: Functions to specify and fit generalized nonlinear models, including models with multiplicative
    interaction terms such as the UNIDIFF model from sociology and the AMMI model from
    crop science, and many others.  Over-parameterized representations of models are
    used throughout; functions are provided for inference on estimable parameter combinations,
    as well as standard methods for diagnostics etc.
