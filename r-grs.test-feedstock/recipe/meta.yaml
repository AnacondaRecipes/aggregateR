  summary: Computational resources for test proposed by Gibbons, Ross, Shanken (1989)<DOI:10.2307/1913625>.
    It also has the functions for the power analysis and the choice of the optimal level
    of significance. The optimal level is determined by minimizing the expected loss
    from hypothesis testing.
