  summary: Conducts linear regression using variational Bayesian inference, particularly optimized
    for genome-wide association mapping and whole-genome prediction which use a number
    of DNA markers as the explanatory variables. Provides seven regression models which
    select the important variables (i.e., the variables related to response variables)
    among the given explanatory variables in different ways (i.e., model structures).
