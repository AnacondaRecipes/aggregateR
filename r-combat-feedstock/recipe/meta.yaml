  summary: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been widely used for identifying common
    variants associated with complex diseases. Due to the small effect sizes of common
    variants, the power to detect individual risk variants is generally low. Complementary
    to SNP-level analysis, a variety of gene-based association tests have been proposed.
    However, the power of existing gene-based tests is often dependent on the underlying
    genetic models, and it is not known a priori which test is optimal.  Here we proposed
    COMBined Association Test (COMBAT) to incorporate strengths from multiple existing
    gene-based tests, including VEGAS, GATES and simpleM. Compared to individual tests,
    COMBAT shows higher overall performance and robustness across a wide range of genetic
    models. The algorithm behind this method is described in Wang et al (2017) <doi:10.1534/genetics.117.300257>.
