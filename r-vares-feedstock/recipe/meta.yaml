  summary: Computes Value at risk and expected shortfall, two most popular measures of financial
    risk, for over one hundred parametric distributions, including all commonly known
    distributions.  Also computed are the corresponding probability density function
    and cumulative distribution function. See Chan, Nadarajah and Afuecheta (2015) <doi:10.1080/03610918.2014.944658>
