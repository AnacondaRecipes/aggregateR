  summary: A native R implementation of grammatical evolution (GE). GE facilitates the discovery
    of programs that can achieve a desired goal. This is done by performing an evolutionary
    optimisation over a population of R expressions generated via a user-defined context-free
    grammar (CFG) and cost function.
