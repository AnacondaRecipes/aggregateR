  summary: 'A S4 class has been created such that complex operations can be executed on each
    cell of a raster map. The raster of objects contains a raster map with the addition
    of a list of generic objects: one object for each raster cells. It allows to write
    few lines of R code for complex map algebra. Two environmental applications about
    frequency analysis of raster map of precipitation and creation of a raster map of
    soil water retention curves have been presented.'
