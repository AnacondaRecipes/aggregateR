  summary: Extensive functions for bivariate copula (bicopula) computations and related operations
    for bicopula theory. The lower, upper, product, and select other bicopula are implemented
    along with operations including the diagonal, survival copula, dual of a copula,
    co-copula, and numerical bicopula density. Level sets, horizontal and vertical sections
    are supported. Numerical derivatives and inverses of a bicopula are provided through
    which simulation is implemented. Bicopula composition, convex combination, asymmetry
    extension, and products also are provided. Support extends to the Kendall Function
    as well as the Lmoments thereof. Kendall Tau, Spearman Rho and Footrule, Gini Gamma,
    Blomqvist Beta, Hoeffding Phi, Schweizer- Wolff Sigma, tail dependency, tail order,
    skewness, and bivariate Lmoments are implemented, and positive/negative quadrant
    dependency, left (right) increasing (decreasing) are available. Other features include
    Kullback-Leibler Divergence, Vuong Procedure, spectral measure, and Lcomoments for
    inference, maximum likelihood, and AIC, BIC, and RMSE for goodness-of-fit.
