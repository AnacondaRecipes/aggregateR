  summary: The main functions perform mixed models analysis by least squares or REML by adding
    the function r() to formulas of lm() and glm(). A collection of text-book statistics
    for higher education is also included, e.g. modifications of the functions lm(),
    glm() and associated summaries from the package 'stats'.
