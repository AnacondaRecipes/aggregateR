  summary: Uses a modification of the published FORTRAN code in "A Computer Program for Generating
    Variance Dispersion Graphs" by G. Vining, Journal of Quality Technology, Vol. 25
    No. 1 January 1993, to produce variance dispersion graphs. Also produces fraction
    of design space plots, and contains data frames for several minimal run response
    surface designs.
