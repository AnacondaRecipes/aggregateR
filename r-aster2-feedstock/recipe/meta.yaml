  summary: Aster models are exponential family regression models for life history analysis.  They
    are like generalized linear models except that elements of the response vector can
    have different families (e. g., some Bernoulli, some Poisson, some zero-truncated
    Poisson, some normal) and can be dependent, the dependence indicated by a graphical
    structure. Discrete time survival analysis, zero-inflated Poisson regression, and
    generalized linear models that are exponential family (e. g., logistic regression
    and Poisson regression with log link) are special cases. Main use is for data in
    which there is survival over discrete time periods and there is additional data
    about what happens conditional on survival (e. g., number of offspring).  Uses the
    exponential family canonical parameterization (aster transform of usual parameterization).
    Unlike the aster package, this package does dependence groups (nodes of the graph
    need not be conditionally independent given their predecessor node), including multinomial
    and two-parameter normal as families.  Thus this package also generalizes mark-capture-recapture
    analysis.
