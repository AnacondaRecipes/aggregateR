  summary: Implements the inference of co-expression networks based on partial correlation coefficients
    from either steady-state or time-course transcriptomic data. Note that with both
    type of data this package can deal with samples collected in different experimental
    conditions and therefore not identically distributed. In this particular case, multiple
    but related networks are inferred on one simone run.
