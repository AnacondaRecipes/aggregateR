  summary: Provides an object type and associated tools for storing and wrangling panel data.
    Implements several methods for creating regression models that take advantage of
    the unique aspects of panel data. Among other capabilities, automates the "within-between"
    (also known as "between-within" and "hybrid") panel regression specification that
    combines the desirable aspects of both fixed effects and random effects econometric
    models and fits them as multilevel models (Allison, 2009 <doi:10.4135/9781412993869.d33>;
    Bell & Jones, 2015 <doi:10.1017/psrm.2014.7>). These models can also be estimated
    via generalized estimating equations (GEE; McNeish, 2019 <doi:10.1080/00273171.2019.1602504>)
    and Bayesian estimation is (optionally) supported via 'Stan'. Supports estimation
    of asymmetric effects models via first differences (Allison, 2019 <doi:10.1177/2378023119826441>)
    as well as a generalized linear model extension thereof using GEE.
