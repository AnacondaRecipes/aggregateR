  summary: Robust tail dependence estimation for bivariate models. This package is based on two
    papers by the authors:'Robust and bias-corrected estimation of the coefficient of
    tail dependence' and 'Robust and bias-corrected estimation of probabilities of extreme
    failure sets'. This work was supported by a research grant (VKR023480) from VILLUM
    FONDEN and an international project for scientific cooperation (PICS-6416).
