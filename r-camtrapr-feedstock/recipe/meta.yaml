  summary: Management of and data extraction from camera trap data in wildlife studies. The package
    provides a workflow for storing and sorting camera trap photos (and videos), tabulates
    records of species and individuals, and creates detection/non-detection matrices
    for occupancy and spatial capture-recapture analyses with great flexibility. In
    addition, it can visualise species activity data and provides simple mapping functions
    with GIS export.
