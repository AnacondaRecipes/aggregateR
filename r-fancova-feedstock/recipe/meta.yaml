  summary: This package contains a collection of R functions to perform nonparametric analysis
    of covariance for regression curves or surfaces. Testing the equality or parallelism
    of nonparametric curves or surfaces is equivalent to analysis of variance (ANOVA)
    or analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for one-sample functional data. Three different
    testing methods are available in the package, including one based on L-2 distance,
    one based on an ANOVA statistic, and one based on variance estimators.
