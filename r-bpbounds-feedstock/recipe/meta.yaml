  summary: Implementation of the nonparametric bounds for the average causal  effect under an
    instrumental variable model by Balke and Pearl (Bounds on  Treatment Effects from
    Studies with Imperfect Compliance, JASA, 1997, 92,  439, 1171-1176). The package
    can calculate bounds for a binary outcome, a  binary treatment/phenotype, and an
    instrument with either 2 or 3  categories. The package implements bounds for situations
    where these 3  variables are measured in the same dataset (trivariate data) or where
    the  outcome and instrument are measured in one study and the  treatment/phenotype
    and instrument are measured in another study  (bivariate data).
