  summary: Creates discretised versions of continuous  distribution functions by mapping continuous
    values  to an underlying discrete grid, based on a (uniform)  frequency of discretisation,
    a valid discretisation  point, and an integration range. For a review of  discretisation
    methods, see  Chakraborty (2015) <doi:10.1186/s40488-015-0028-6>.
