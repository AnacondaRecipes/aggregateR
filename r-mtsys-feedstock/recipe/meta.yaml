  summary: Mahalanobis-Taguchi (MT) system is a collection of multivariate analysis methods developed
    for the field of quality engineering. MT system consists of two families depending
    on their purpose. One is a family of Mahalanobis-Taguchi (MT) methods (in the broad
    sense) for diagnosis (see Woodall, W. H., Koudelik, R., Tsui, K. L., Kim, S. B.,
    Stoumbos, Z. G., and Carvounis, C. P. (2003) <doi:10.1198/004017002188618626>) and
    the other is a family of Taguchi (T) methods for forecasting (see Kawada, H., and
    Nagata, Y. (2015) <doi:10.17929/tqs.1.12>). The MT package contains three basic
    methods for the family of MT methods and one basic method for the family of T methods.
    The MT method (in the narrow sense), the Mahalanobis-Taguchi Adjoint (MTA) methods,
    and the Recognition-Taguchi (RT) method are for the MT method and the two-sided
    Taguchi (T1) method is for the family of T methods. In addition, the Ta and Tb methods,
    which are the improved versions of the T1 method, are included.
