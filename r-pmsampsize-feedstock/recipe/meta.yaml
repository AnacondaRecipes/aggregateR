  summary: 'Computes the minimum sample size required for the development of a new multivariable
    prediction model using the criteria proposed by Riley et al. (2018) <doi: 10.1002/sim.7992>.
    pmsampsize can be used to calculate the minimum sample size for the development
    of models with continuous, binary or survival (time-to-event) outcomes. Riley et
    al. (2018) <doi: 10.1002/sim.7992> lay out a series of criteria the sample size
    should meet. These aim to minimise the overfitting and to ensure precise estimation
    of key parameters in the prediction model.'
