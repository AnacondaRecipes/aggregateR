  summary: Computes the penalized maximum likelihood estimates of factor loadings and unique
    variances for various tuning parameters. The pathwise coordinate descent along with
    EM algorithm is used.  This package also includes a new graphical tool which outputs
    path diagram, goodness-of-fit indices and model selection criteria for each regularization
    parameter. The user can change the regularization parameter by manipulating scrollbars,
    which is helpful to find a suitable value of regularization parameter.
