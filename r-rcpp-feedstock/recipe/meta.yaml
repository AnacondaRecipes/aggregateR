  summary: The 'Rcpp' package provides R functions as well as C++ classes which offer a seamless
    integration of R and C++. Many R data types and objects can be mapped back and forth
    to C++ equivalents which facilitates both writing of new code as well as easier
    integration of third-party libraries. Documentation about 'Rcpp' is provided by
    several vignettes included in this package, via the 'Rcpp Gallery' site at <https://gallery.rcpp.org>,
