  summary: The function MC3() searches for log-linear models with the highest posterior probability.
    The function gibbsSampler() is a blocked Gibbs sampler for sampling from the posterior
    distribution of the log-linear parameters. The functions findPostMean() and findPostCov()
    compute the posterior mean and covariance matrix for decomposable models which,
    for these models, is available in closed form.
