  summary: An implementation of tools for design of attribute  variable sampling interval cumulative
    sum chart.  It currently provides information for monitoring of mean increase such
    as  average number of sample to signal, average time to signal, a matrix of transient
    probabilities, suitable control limits when the data are (zero inflated) Poisson/binomial
    distribution.  Functions in the tools can be easily applied to other count processes.
    Also, tools might be extended to more complicated cumulative sum control chart.
    We leave these issues as our perpetual work.
