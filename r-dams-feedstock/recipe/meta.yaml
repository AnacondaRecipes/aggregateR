  summary: The single largest source of dams in the United States is the National Inventory of
    Dams (NID) <http://nid.usace.army.mil> from the US Army Corps of Engineers. Entire
    data from the NID cannot be obtained all at once and NID's website limits extraction
    of more than a couple of thousand records at a time. Moreover, selected data from
    the NID's user interface cannot not be saved to a file. In order to make the analysis
    of this data easier, all the data from NID was extracted manually. Subsequently,
    the raw data was checked for potential errors and cleaned. This package provides
    sample cleaned data from the NID and provides functionality to access the entire
    cleaned NID data.
