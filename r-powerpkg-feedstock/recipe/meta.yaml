  summary: (1) To estimate the power of testing for linkage using an affected sib pair design,
    as a function of the recurrence risk ratios. We will use analytical power formulae
    as implemented in R. These are based on a Mathematica notebook created by Martin
    Farrall. (2) To examine how the power of the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT)
    depends on the disease allele frequency, the marker allele frequency, the strength
    of the linkage disequilibrium, and the magnitude of the genetic effect. We will
    use an R program that implements the power formulae of Abel and Muller-Myhsok (1998).
    These formulae allow one to quickly compute power of the TDT approach under a variety
    of different conditions. This R program was modeled on Martin Farrall's Mathematica
    notebook.
