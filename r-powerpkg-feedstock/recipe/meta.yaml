  summary: 'There are two main functions: (1) To estimate the power of testing for linkage using
    an affected sib pair design, as a function of the recurrence risk ratios. We will
    use analytical power formulae as implemented in R. These are based on a Mathematica
    notebook created by Martin Farrall. (2) To examine how the power of the transmission
    disequilibrium test (TDT) depends on the disease allele frequency, the marker allele
    frequency, the strength of the linkage disequilibrium, and the magnitude of the
    genetic effect. We will use an R program that implements the power formulae of Abel
    and Muller-Myhsok (1998). These formulae allow one to quickly compute power of the
    TDT approach under a variety of different conditions. This R program was modeled
    on Martin Farrall''s Mathematica notebook.'
