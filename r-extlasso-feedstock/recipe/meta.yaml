  summary: Estimates coefficients of extended LASSO penalized linear regression and generalized
    linear models. Currently lasso and elastic net penalized linear regression and generalized
    linear models are considered. This package currently utilizes an accurate approximation
    of L1 penalty and then a modified Jacobi algorithm to estimate the coefficients.
    There is provision for plotting of the solutions and predictions of coefficients
    at given values of lambda. This package also contains functions for cross validation
    to select a suitable lambda value given the data. Also provides a function for estimation
    in fused lasso penalized linear regression. For more details, see Mandal, B. N.(2014).
    Computational methods for L1 penalized GLM model fitting, unpublished report submitted
    to Macquarie University, NSW, Australia.
