  summary: The package estimates coefficients of extended LASSO penalized linear regression and
    generalized linear models. Currently lasso and elastic net penalized linear regression
    and generalized linear models are considered. The package currently utilizes an
    accurate approximation of L1 penalty and then a modified Jacobi algorithm to estimate
    the coefficients. There is provision for plotting of the solutions and predictions
    of coefficients at given values of lambda. The package also contains functions for
    cross validation to select a suitable lambda value given the data. The package also
    provides a function for estimation in fused lasso penalized linear regression.
