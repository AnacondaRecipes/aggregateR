  summary: A statistical tool for multivariate modeling and clustering using stepwise cluster
    analysis. The modeling output of rSCA is constructed as a cluster tree to represent
    the complicated relationships between multiple dependent and independent variables.
    A free tool (named rSCA Tree Generator) for visualizing the cluster tree from rSCA
    is also released and it can be downloaded at <https://rscatree.weebly.com/>.
