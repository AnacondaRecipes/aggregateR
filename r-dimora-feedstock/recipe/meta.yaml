  summary: 'The implemented methods are: Standard Bass model, Generalized Bass model (with rectangular
    shock, exponential shock, and mixed shock. You can choose to add from 1 to 3 shocks),
    Guseo-Guidolin model and Variable Potential Market model, and UCRCD model. The Bass
    model consists of a simple differential equation that describes the process of how
    new products get adopted in a population, the Generalized Bass model is a generalization
    of the Bass model in which there is a "carrier" function x(t) that allows to change
    the speed of time sliding. In some real processes the reachable potential of the
    resource available in a temporal instant may appear to be not constant over time,
    because of this we use Variable Potential Market model, in which the Guseo-Guidolin
    has a particular specification for the market function. The UCRCD model (Unbalanced
    Competition and Regime Change Diachronic) is a diffusion model used to capture the
    dynamics of the competitive or collaborative transition.'
