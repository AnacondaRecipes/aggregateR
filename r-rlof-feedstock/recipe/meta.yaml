  summary: 'R parallel implementation of Local Outlier Factor(LOF) which uses multiple CPUs to
    significantly speed up the LOF computation for large datasets. (Note: The overall
    performance depends on the computers especially the number of the cores).It also
    supports multiple k values to be calculated in parallel, as well as various distance
    measures in addition to the default Euclidean distance. '
