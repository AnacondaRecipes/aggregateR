  summary: 'Contains a large number of the goodness-of-fit tests for the Exponential and Weibull
    distributions classified into families: the tests based on the empirical distribution
    function, the tests based on the probability plot, the tests based on the normalized
    spacings, the tests based on the Laplace transform and the likelihood based tests.'
