  summary: Define and use graphical elements of corporate design manuals in R. The 'unikn' package
    provides color functions (by defining dedicated colors and color palettes, and commands
    for changing, viewing, and using them) and styled text elements (e.g., for marking,
    underlining, or plotting colored titles). The pre-defined range of colors and text
    functions is based on the corporate design of the University of Konstanz <https://www.uni-konstanz.de/>,
    but can be adapted and extended for other institutions and purposes.
