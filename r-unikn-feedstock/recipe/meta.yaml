  summary: Define and use graphical elements of corporate design manuals in R. The 'unikn' package
    provides color functions (by defining dedicated colors and color palettes, and commands
    for finding, changing, viewing, and using them) and styled text elements (e.g.,
    for marking, underlining, or plotting colored titles). The pre-defined range of
    colors and text decoration functions is based on the corporate design of the University
    of Konstanz <https://www.uni-konstanz.de/>, but can be adapted and extended for
    other purposes or institutions.
