  summary: 'Define and use graphical elements of corporate design manuals in R. The ''unikn''
    package provides color functions (by defining dedicated colors and color palettes,
    and commands for changing, viewing, and using them) and styled text elements (e.g.,
    for marking, underlining, or plotting colored titles). The pre-defined range of
    colors and text functions is based on the corporate design of the University of
    Konstanz <https://www.uni-konstanz.de/>, but can be adapted and extended for other
    institutions and purposes. '
