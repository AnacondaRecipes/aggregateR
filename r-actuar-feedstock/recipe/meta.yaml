  summary: 'Functions and data sets for actuarial science: modeling of loss distributions; risk
    theory and ruin theory; simulation of compound models, discrete mixtures and compound
    hierarchical models; credibility theory. Support for many additional probability
    distributions to model insurance loss size and frequency: 23 continuous heavy tailed
    distributions; the Poisson-inverse Gaussian discrete distribution; zero-truncated
    and zero-modified extensions of the standard discrete distributions. Support for
    phase-type distributions commonly used to compute ruin probabilities.'
