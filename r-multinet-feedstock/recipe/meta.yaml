The package uses functions from eclat <https://borgelt.net/eclat.html>, for association rule mining, Infomap <https://www.mapequation.org>, for the Infomap community detection method (please refer to their web site for up-to-date code), and Howard Hinnant's date and time library <https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date>. The code from these libraries has been included in our source package.
