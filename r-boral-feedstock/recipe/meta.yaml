  summary: 'Bayesian approaches for analyzing multivariate data in ecology. Estimation is performed
    using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods via Three. JAGS types of models may
    be fitted: 1) With explanatory variables only, boral fits independent column Generalized
    Linear Models (GLMs) to each column of the response matrix; 2) With latent variables
    only, boral fits a purely latent variable model for model-based unconstrained ordination;
    3) With explanatory and latent variables, boral fits correlated column GLMs with
    latent variables to account for any residual correlation between the columns of
    the response matrix.'
