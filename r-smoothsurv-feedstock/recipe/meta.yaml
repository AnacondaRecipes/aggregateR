  summary: Contains, as a main contribution, a function to fit a regression model with possibly
    right, left or interval censored observations and with the error distribution expressed
    as a mixture of G-splines. Core part of the computation is done in compiled C++
    written using the Scythe Statistical Library Version 0.3.
