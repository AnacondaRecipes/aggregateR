  summary: This package contains functions to run propensity-biased allocation to balance covariate
    distributions in sequential trials and propensity-constrained randomization to balance
    covariate distributions in trials with known baseline covariates at time of randomization.  Currently
    this package only supports trials comparing two groups.
