  summary: The holonomic gradient method (HGM, hgm) gives a way to evaluate normalization constants
    of unnormalized probability distributions by utilizing holonomic  systems of differential
    or difference equations. The holonomic gradient descent (HGD, hgd) gives a method
    to find maximal likelihood estimates by utilizing the HGM.
