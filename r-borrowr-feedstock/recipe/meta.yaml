  summary: Estimate population average treatment effects from a primary data source with borrowing
    from supplemental sources. Causal estimation is done with either a Bayesian linear
    model or with Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) to adjust for confounding.
    Borrowing is done with multisource exchangeability models (MEMs). For information
    on BART, see Chipman, George, & McCulloch (2010) <doi:10.1214/09-AOAS285>. For information
    on MEMs, see Kaizer, Koopmeiners, & Hobbs (2018) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxx031>.
