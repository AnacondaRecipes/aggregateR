  summary: Time series regression.  The dyn class interfaces ts, irts(), zoo() and zooreg() time
    series classes to lm(), glm(), loess(), quantreg::rq(), MASS::rlm(), MCMCpack::MCMCregress(),
    quantreg::rq(), randomForest::randomForest() and other regression functions allowing
    those functions to be used with time series including specifications that may contain
    lags, diffs and missing values.
