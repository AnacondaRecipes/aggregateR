  summary: An abstract DList class helps storing large list-type objects in a distributed manner.
    Corresponding high-level functions and methods for handling distributed storage
    (DStorage) and lists allows for processing such DLists on distributed systems efficiently.
    In doing so it uses a well defined storage backend implemented based on the DStorage
    class.
