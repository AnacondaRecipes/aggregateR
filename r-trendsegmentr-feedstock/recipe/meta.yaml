  summary: Performs the detection of point anomalies and linear trend changes  for univariate
    time series by implementing the bottom-up unbalanced wavelet transformation  proposed
    by H. Maeng and P. Fryzlewicz (2019) <http://personal.lse.ac.uk/maengh/>.  The estimated
    number and locations of the change-points are returned with the  piecewise-linear
    estimator for signal.
