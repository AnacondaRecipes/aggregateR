  summary: Performs the detection of linear trend changes for univariate time series by implementing
    the bottom-up unbalanced wavelet transformation proposed by H. Maeng and P. Fryzlewicz
    (2021). The estimated number and locations of the change-points are returned with
    the piecewise-linear estimator for signal.
