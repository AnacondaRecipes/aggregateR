  summary: A complete set of functions to calculate several EBLUP (Empirical Best Linear Unbiased
    Predictor) estimators and their mean squared errors. All estimators are based on
    an area-level linear mixed model introduced by Rao and Yu in 1994 (see documentation).
    The REML method is used for fitting this model.
