  summary: Provides a toolkit for analytical variance estimation in survey sampling. Apart from
    the implementation of standard variance estimators, its main feature is to help
    the sampling expert produce easy-to-use variance estimation "wrappers", where systematic
    operations (linearization, domain estimation) are handled in a consistent and transparent
    way.
