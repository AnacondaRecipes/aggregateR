  summary: Generates efficient balanced mixed-level k-circulant supersaturated designs by interchanging
    the elements of the generator vector. Attempts to generate a supersaturated design
    that has EfNOD efficiency more than user specified efficiency level (mef). Displays
    the progress of generation of an efficient mixed-level k-circulant design through
    a progress bar. The progress of 100 per cent means that one full round of interchange
    is completed. More than one full round (typically 4-5 rounds) of interchange may
    be required for larger designs. For more details, please see Mandal, B.N., Gupta

    Designs, Journal of Statistical Theory and Practice, 5:4, 627-648, <doi:10.1080/15598608.2011.10483735>.
