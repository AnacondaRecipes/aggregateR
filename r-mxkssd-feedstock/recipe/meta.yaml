  summary: mxkssd is a package that generates efficient balanced mixed-level k-circulant supersaturated
    designs by interchanging the elements of the generator vector. The package tries
    to generate a supersaturated design that has EfNOD efficiency more than user specified
    efficiency level (mef). The package also displays the progress of generation of
    an efficient mixed-level k-circulant design through a progress bar. The progress
    of 100 per cent means that one full round of interchange is completed. More than
    one full round (typically 4-5 rounds) of interchange may be required for larger
    designs.
