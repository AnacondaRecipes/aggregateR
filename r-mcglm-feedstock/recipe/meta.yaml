  summary: Fitting multivariate covariance generalized linear models (McGLMs) to data.  McGLM
    is a general framework for non-normal multivariate data analysis, designed to handle
    multivariate response variables, along with a wide range of temporal and spatial
    correlation structures defined in terms of a covariance link function combined with
    a matrix linear predictor involving known matrices. The models take non-normality
    into account in the conventional way by means of a variance function, and the mean
    structure is modelled by means of a link function and a linear predictor. The models
    are fitted using an efficient Newton scoring algorithm based on quasi-likelihood
    and Pearson estimating functions, using only second-moment assumptions. This provides
    a unified approach to a wide variety of different types of response variables and
    covariance structures, including multivariate extensions of repeated measures, time
    series, longitudinal, spatial and spatio-temporal structures. The package offers
    a user-friendly interface for fitting McGLMs similar to the glm() R function.  See
    Bonat (2018) <doi:10.18637/jss.v084.i04>, for more information  and examples.
