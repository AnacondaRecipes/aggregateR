  summary: 'Provides a new method for identification of clusters of genomic regions within chromosomes.
    Primarily, it is used for calling clusters of cis-regulatory elements (COREs). ''CREAM''
    uses genome-wide maps of genomic regions in the tissue or cell type of interest,
    such as those generated from chromatin-based assays including DNaseI, ATAC or ChIP-Seq.
    ''CREAM'' considers proximity of the elements within chromosomes of a given sample
    to identify COREs in the following steps: 1) It identifies window size or the maximum
    allowed distance between the elements within each CORE, 2) It identifies number
    of elements which should be clustered as a CORE, 3) It calls COREs, 4) It filters
    the COREs with lowest order which does not pass the threshold considered in the
    approach.'
