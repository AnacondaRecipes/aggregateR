  summary: Damage Functions (DFs), also known as Vulnerability Functions, associate the physical
    damage to a building or a structure (and also its contents and inventory) from natural
    disasters to financial damage. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in
    USA developed several thousand DFs and these serve as a benchmark in natural catastrophe
    modeling, both in academia and industry. However, these DFs and their documentation
    are buried within the HAZUS software are not easily accessible for analysis and
    visualization. This package provides more than 1300 raw DFs used by FEMA's HAZUS
    software and also functionality to extract and visualize DFs specific to the flood
    hazard. The vignette included with this package demonstrates its use.
