  summary: A toolkit containing statistical analysis models motivated by multivariate forms of
    the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (COM-Poisson) distribution for flexible modeling of multivariate
    count data, especially in the presence of data dispersion. Currently the package
    only supports bivariate data, via the bivariate COM-Poisson distribution described
    in Sellers et al. (2016) <doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2016.04.007>. Future development will
    extend the package to higher-dimensional data.
