  summary: Functions to calculate power and sample size for testing (1) mediation effects; (2)
    the slope in a simple linear regression; (3) odds ratio in a simple logistic regression;
    (4) mean change for longitudinal study with 2 time points; (5) interaction effect
    in 2-way ANOVA; and (6) the slope in a simple Poisson regression.
