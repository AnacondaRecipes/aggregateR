  summary: Functions for studying realized genetic relatedness between people. Users will be
    able to simulate inheritance patterns given pedigree structures, generate SNP marker
    data given inheritance patterns, and estimate realized relatedness between pairs
    of individuals using SNP marker data. See Wang (2017) <doi:10.1534/genetics.116.197004>.
