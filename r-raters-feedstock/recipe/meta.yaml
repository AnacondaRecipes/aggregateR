  summary: The kappa statistic implemented by Fleiss is a very popular index for assessing the
    reliability of agreement among multiple observers. It is used both in the psychological
    and in the psychiatric field. Other fields of application are typically medicine,
    biology and engineering. Unfortunately,the kappa statistic may behave inconsistently
    in case of strong agreement between raters, since this index assumes lower values
    than it would have been expected. We propose a modification kappa implemented by
    Fleiss in case of nominal and ordinal variables. Monte Carlo simulations are used
    both to testing statistical hypotheses and to calculating percentile bootstrap confidence
    intervals based on proposed statistic in case of nominal and ordinal data.
