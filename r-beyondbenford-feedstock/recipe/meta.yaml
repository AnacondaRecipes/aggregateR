  summary: 'Allows to compare the goodness of fit of Benford''s and Blondeau Da Silva''s digit
    distributions in a dataset. It is used to check whether the data distribution is
    consistent with theoretical distributions highlighted by Blondeau Da Silva or not
    (through the dat.distr() function): this ideal theoretical distribution must be
    at least approximately followed by the data for the use of Blondeau Da Silva''s
    model to be well-founded. It also enables to plot histograms of digit distributions,
    both observed in the dataset and given by the two theoretical approaches (with the
    digit.ditr() function). Finally, it proposes to quantify the goodness of fit via
    Pearson''s chi-squared test (with the chi2() function).'
