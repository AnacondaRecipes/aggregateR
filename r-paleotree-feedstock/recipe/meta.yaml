  summary: Provides tools for transforming, a posteriori time-scaling, and modifying phylogenies
    containing extinct (i.e. fossil) lineages. In particular, most users are interested
    in the functions timePaleoPhy, bin_timePaleoPhy, cal3TimePaleoPhy and bin_cal3TimePaleoPhy,
    which date cladograms of fossil taxa using stratigraphic data. This package also
    contains a large number of likelihood functions for estimating sampling and diversification
    rates from different types of data available from the fossil record (e.g. range
    data, occurrence data, etc). paleotree users can also simulate diversification and
    sampling in the fossil record using the function simFossilRecord, which is a detailed
    simulator for branching birth-death-sampling processes composed of discrete taxonomic
    units arranged in ancestor-descendant relationships. Users can use simFossilRecord
    to simulate diversification in incompletely sampled fossil records, under various
    models of morphological differentiation (i.e. the various patterns by which morphotaxa
    originate from one another), and with time-dependent, longevity-dependent and/or
    diversity-dependent rates of diversification, extinction and sampling. Additional
    functions allow users to translate simulated ancestor-descendant data from simFossilRecord
    into standard time-scaled phylogenies or unscaled cladograms that reflect the relationships
    among taxon units.
