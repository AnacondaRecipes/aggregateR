  summary: Provides a replacement and extension of the optim() function to call to several function
    minimization codes in R in a single statement. These methods handle smooth, possibly
    box constrained functions of several or many parameters. Note that function 'optimr()'
    was prepared to simplify the incorporation of minimization codes going forward.
    Also implements some utility codes and some extra solvers, including safeguarded
    Newton methods. Many methods previously separate are now included here. This is
    the version for CRAN.
