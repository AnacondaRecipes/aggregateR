  summary: Analyzes and modifies metabolomics raw data (generated using GC-APCI-MS, Gas Chromatography-Atmospheric
    Pressure Chemical Ionization-Mass Spectrometry) to correct overloaded signals, i.e.
    ion intensities exceeding detector saturation leading to a cut-off peak. Data in
    xcmsRaw format are accepted as input and mzXML files can be processed alternatively.
    Overloaded signals are detected automatically and modified using an Gaussian or
    Isotopic-Ratio approach, QC plots are generated and corrected data are stored within
    the original xcmsRaw or mzXML respectively to allow further processing.
