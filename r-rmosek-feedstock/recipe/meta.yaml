  summary: 'This is a meta-package designed to support the installation of Rmosek (>= 6.0) and
    bring the optimization facilities of MOSEK (>= 6.0) to the R-language. The interface
    supports large-scale optimization of many kinds: Mixed-integer and continuous linear,
    second-order cone, exponential cone and power cone optimization, as well as continuous
    semidefinite optimization. Rmosek and the R-language are open-source projects. MOSEK
    is a proprietary product, but unrestricted trial and academic licenses are available.'
