  summary: 'The Datasaurus Dozen is a set of datasets with the same summary statistics. They
    retain the same summary statistics despite having radically different distributions.  The
    datasets represent a larger and quirkier object lesson that is typically taught
    via Anscombe''s Quartet (available in the ''datasets'' package). Anscombe''s Quartet
    contains four very different distributions with the same summary statistics and
    as such highlights the value of visualisation in understanding data, over and above
    summary statistics. As well as being an engaging variant on the Quartet, the data
    is generated in a novel way. The simulated annealing process used to derive datasets
    from the original Datasaurus is detailed in "Same Stats, Different Graphs: Generating
    Datasets with Varied Appearance and Identical Statistics through Simulated Annealing"
    <doi:10.1145/3025453.3025912>.'
