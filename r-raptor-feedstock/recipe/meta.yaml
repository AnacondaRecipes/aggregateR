  summary: Performs wood cell anatomical data analyses on spatially explicit xylem (tracheids)
    datasets derived from thin sections of woody tissue. The package includes functions
    for visualisation, detection and alignment of continuous tracheid radial file (defined
    as rows) and individual tracheid position within an annual ring of coniferous species.
    This package is designed to be used with elaborate cell output, e.g. as provided
    with ROXAS (von Arx & Carrer, 2014 <doi:10.1016/j.dendro.2013.12.001>). The package
    has been validated for Picea abies, Larix Siberica, Pinus cembra and Pinus sylvestris.
