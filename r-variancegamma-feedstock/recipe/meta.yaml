  summary: Provides functions for the variance gamma distribution. Density, distribution and
    quantile functions. Functions for random number generation and fitting of the variance
    gamma to data. Also, functions for computing moments of the variance gamma distribution
    of any order about any location. In addition, there are functions for checking the
    validity of parameters and to interchange different sets of parameterizations for
    the variance gamma distribution.
