  summary: Provides an R API to the Open Source Geometry Engine ('GEOS') library (<https://libgeos.org/>)
    and a vector format with which to efficiently store 'GEOS' geometries. High-performance
    functions to extract information from, calculate relationships between, and transform
    geometries are provided. Finally, facilities to import and export geometry vectors
    to other spatial formats are provided.
