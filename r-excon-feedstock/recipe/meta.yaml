  summary: Interactive tools to explore topographic-like data sets.  Such data sets take the
    form of a matrix in which the rows and columns provide location/frequency information,
    and the matrix elements contain altitude/response information.  Such data is found
    in cartography, 2D spectroscopy and chemometrics.  The functions in this package
    create interactive web pages showing the contoured data, possibly with slices from
    the original matrix parallel to each dimension. The interactive behavior is created
    using the 'D3.js' 'JavaScript' library by Mike Bostock.
