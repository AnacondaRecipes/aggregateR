  summary: Run computer experiments using the adaptive composite grid algorithm with a Gaussian
    process model. The algorithm works best when running an experiment that can evaluate
    thousands of points from a deterministic computer simulation. This package is an
    implementation of a forthcoming paper by Plumlee, Erickson, Ankenman, et al. For
    a preprint of the paper, contact the maintainer of this package.
