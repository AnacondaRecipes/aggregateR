  summary: Calculates conditional exact tests (Fisher's exact test, Blaker's exact test, or  exact
    McNemar's test) and unconditional exact tests (including score-based tests on differences
    in proportions, ratios of proportions, and odds ratios, and Boshcloo's test) with
    appropriate matching confidence intervals, and provides power and sample size calculations.
    Gives melded confidence intervals for the binomial case (Fay, et al, 2015, <DOI:10.1111/biom.12231>).
    Gives boundary-optimized rejection region test (Gabriel, et al, 2018, <DOI:10.1002/sim.7579>),
    an unconditional exact test for the situation where the controls are all expected
    to fail. Gives confidence intervals compatible with exact McNemar's or sign tests
    (Fay and Lumbard, 2021, <DOI:10.1002/sim.8829>). For review of these kinds of exact
    tests see Fay and Hunsberger (2021, <DOI:10.1214/21-SS131>).
