  summary: 'Multiple Hypothesis Testing For Variable Selection in high dimensional linear models.
    This package performs variable selection with multiple hypothesis testing, either
    for ordered variable selection or non-ordered variable selection. In both cases,
    a sequential procedure is performed. It starts to test the null hypothesis "no variable
    is relevant"; if this hypothesis is rejected, it then tests "only the first variable
    is relevant", and so on until the null hypothesis is accepted. '
