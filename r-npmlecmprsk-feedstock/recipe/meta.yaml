  summary: Given a failure type, the function computes covariate-specific probability of failure
    over time and covariate-specific conditional hazard rate based on possibly right-censored
    competing risk data. Specifically, it computes the non-parametric maximum-likelihood
    estimates of these quantities and their asymptotic variances in a semi-parametric
    mixture model for competing-risks data, as described in Chang et al. (2007a).
