  summary: We propose weighted SVM methods with penalization form. By adding weights to loss
    term, we can build up weighted SVM easily and examine classification algorithm properties
    under weighted SVM. Through comparing each of test error rates, we conclude that
    our Weighted SVM with boosting has predominant properties than the standard SVM
    have, as a whole.
