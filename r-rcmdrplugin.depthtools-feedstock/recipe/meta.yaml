  summary: We provide an Rcmdr plug-in based on the depthTools package, which implements different
    robust statistical tools for the description and analysis of gene expression data
    based on the Modified Band Depth, namely, the scale curves for visualizing the dispersion
    of one or various groups of samples (e.g. types of tumors), a rank test to decide
    whether two groups of samples come from a single distribution and two methods of
    supervised classification techniques, the DS and TAD methods.
