  summary: Provides methods for examining posterior MCMC samples from a single chain using trace
    plots and density plots, and from multiple chains by comparing posterior medians
    and credible intervals from each chain.  These plotting functions have a variety
    of options, such as figure sizes, legends, parameters to plot, and saving plots
    to file. Functions interface with the NIMBLE software package, see de Valpine, Turek,
    Paciorek, Anderson-Bergman, Temple Lang and Bodik (2017) <doi:10.1080/10618600.2016.1172487>.
