  summary: A collection of methods to determine the required sample size for the evaluation of
    inequality constrained hypotheses by means of a Bayes factor. Alternatively, for
    a given sample size, the unconditional error probabilities or the expected conditional
    error probabilities can be determined. Additional material on the methods in this
    package is available in Klaassen, F., Hoijtink, H. & Gu, X. (2019) <doi:10.31219/osf.io/d5kf3>.
