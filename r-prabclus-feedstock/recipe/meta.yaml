  summary: Distance-based parametric bootstrap tests for clustering with spatial neighborhood
    information. Some distance measures, Clustering of presence-absence, abundance and
    multilocus genetic data for species delimitation, nearest neighbor based noise detection.
    Genetic distances between communities. Tests whether various distance-based regressions
    are equal. Try package?prabclus for on overview.
