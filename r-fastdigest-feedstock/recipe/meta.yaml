  summary: Provides an R interface to Bob Jenkin's streaming, non-cryptographic 'SpookyHash'
    hash algorithm for use in digest-based comparisons of R objects. 'fastdigest' plugs
    directly into R's internal serialization machinery, allowing digests of all R objects
    the serialize() function supports, including reference-style objects via custom
    hooks. Speed is high and scales linearly by object size; memory usage is constant
    and negligible.
