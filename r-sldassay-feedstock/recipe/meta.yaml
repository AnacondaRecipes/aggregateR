  summary: Calculates maximum likelihood estimate, exact and asymptotic confidence intervals,
    and exact and asymptotic goodness of fit p-values for concentration of infectious
    units from serial limiting dilution assays. This package uses the likelihood equation,
    exact goodness of fit p-values, and exact confidence intervals described in Meyers
    et al. (1994) <http://jcm.asm.org/content/32/3/732.full.pdf>. This software is also
    implemented as a web application through the Shiny R package <https://iupm.shinyapps.io/sldassay/>.
