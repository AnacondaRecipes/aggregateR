  summary: 'Mainly data sets to accompany the VGAM package and the book "Vector Generalized Linear
    and Additive Models: With an Implementation in R" (Yee, 2015) <DOI:10.1007/978-1-4939-2818-7>.
    These are used to illustrate vector generalized linear and additive models (VGLMs/VGAMs),
    and associated models (Reduced-Rank VGLMs, Quadratic RR-VGLMs, Row-Column Interaction
    Models, and constrained and unconstrained ordination models in ecology). This package
    now contains some old VGAM family functions which have been replaced by newer ones
    (often because they are now special cases).'
