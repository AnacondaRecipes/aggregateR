  summary: 'Data sets to accompany the VGAM package and the book "Vector Generalized Linear and
    Additive Models: With an Implementation in R" (Yee, 2015) <DOI:10.1007/978-1-4939-2818-7>.
    These are used to illustrate vector generalized linear and additive models (VGLMs/VGAMs),
    and associated models (Reduced-Rank VGLMs, Quadratic RR-VGLMs, Row-Column Interaction
    Models, and constrained and unconstrained ordination models in ecology).'
