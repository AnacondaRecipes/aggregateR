  summary: Implementation of fast algorithms for wild cluster bootstrap inference developed in
    'Roodman et al' (2019, 'STATA' Journal, <doi:10.1177/1536867X19830877>) and 'MacKinnon
    et al' (2022), which makes it feasible to quickly calculate bootstrap test statistics
    based on a large number of bootstrap draws even for large samples. Multiple bootstrap
    types as described in 'MacKinnon, Nielsen & Webb' (2022) are supported. Further,
    'multiway' clustering, regression weights, bootstrap weights, fixed effects and
    'subcluster' bootstrapping are supported. Further, both restricted ('WCR') and unrestricted
    ('WCU') bootstrap are supported. Methods are provided for a variety of fitted models,
    including 'lm()', 'feols()' (from package 'fixest') and 'felm()' (from package 'lfe').
    Additionally implements a 'heteroskedasticity-robust' ('HC1') wild bootstrap. Last,
    the package provides an R binding to 'WildBootTests.jl', which provides additional
    speed gains and functionality, including the 'WRE' bootstrap for instrumental variable
    models (based on models of type 'ivreg()' from package 'ivreg') and hypotheses with
    q > 1.
