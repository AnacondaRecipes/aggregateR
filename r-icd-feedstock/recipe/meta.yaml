  summary: Calculate comorbidities, medical risk scores, and work very quickly and precisely
    with ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. This package enables a work flow from raw tables of
    ICD codes in hospital databases to comorbidities. ICD-9 and ICD-10 comorbidity mappings
    from Quan (Deyo and Elixhauser versions), Elixhauser and AHRQ included. Common ambiguities
    and code formats are handled. Comorbidity computation includes Hierarchical Condition
    Codes, and an implementation of AHRQ Clinical Classifications. Risk scores include
    those of Charlson and van Walraven.  US Clinical Modification, Word Health Organization,
    Belgian and French ICD-10 codes are supported, most of which are downloaded on demand.
