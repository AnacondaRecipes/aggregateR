  summary: The purpose of this package is to provide a lightweight and unified Future API for
    sequential and parallel processing of R expression via futures.  The simplest way
    to evaluate an expression in parallel is to use `x %<-% { expression }` with `plan(multisession)`.
    This package implements sequential, multicore, multisession, and cluster futures.  With
    these, R expressions can be evaluated on the local machine, in parallel a set of
    local machines, or distributed on a mix of local and remote machines. Extensions
    to this package implement additional backends for processing futures via compute
    cluster schedulers, etc. Because of its unified API, there is no need to modify
    any code in order switch from sequential on the local machine to, say, distributed
    processing on a remote compute cluster. Another strength of this package is that
    global variables and functions are automatically identified and exported as needed,
    making it straightforward to tweak existing code to make use of futures.
