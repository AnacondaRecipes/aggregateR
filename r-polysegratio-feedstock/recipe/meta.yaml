  summary: Perform classic chi-squared tests and Ripol et al(1999) binomial confidence interval
    approach for autopolyploid dominant markers. Also, dominant markers may be generated
    for families of offspring where either one or both of the parents possess the marker.
    Missing values and misclassified markers may be generated at random.
