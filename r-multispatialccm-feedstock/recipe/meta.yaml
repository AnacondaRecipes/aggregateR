  summary: "The multispatial convergent cross mapping algorithm can be used as a test for causal
    associations between pairs of processes represented by time series. This is a combination
    of convergent cross mapping (CCM), described in Sugihara et al., 2012, Science,
    338, 496-500, and dew-drop regression, described in Hsieh et al., 2008, American
    Naturalist, 171, 71\u201380. The algorithm allows CCM to be implemented on data
    that are not from a single long time series. Instead, data can come from many short
    time series, which are stitched together using bootstrapping."
