  summary: Performs Geographically Weighted Fractal Analysis (GWFA) to calculate the local fractal
    dimension of a set of points. GWFA mixes the Sandbox multifractal algorithm and
    the Geographically Weighted Regression. Unlike fractal box-counting algorithm, the
    sandbox algorithm avoids border effects because the boxes are adjusted on the set
    of points. The Geographically Weighted approach consists in applying a kernel that
    describes the way the neighbourhood of each estimated point is taken into account
    to estimate its fractal dimension. GWFA can be used to discriminate built patterns
    of a city, a region, or a whole country.
