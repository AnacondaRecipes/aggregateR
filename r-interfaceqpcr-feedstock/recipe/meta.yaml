  summary: Graphical User Interface allowing to determine the concentration in the sample in
    CFU per mL or in number of copies per mL provided to qPCR results after with or
    without PMA treatment. This package is simply to use because no knowledge in R commands
    is necessary. A graphic represents the standard curve, and a table containing the
    result for each sample is created.
