  summary: 'Time-Temperature Superposition analysis is often applied to frequency modulated data
    obtained by Dynamic Mechanic Analysis (DMA) and Rheometry in the analytical chemistry
    and physics areas. These techniques provide estimates of material mechanical properties
    (such as moduli) at different temperatures in a wider range of time. This package
    provides the Time-Temperature superposition Master Curve at a referred temperature
    by the three methods: the two wider used methods, Arrhenius based methods and WLF,
    and the newer methodology based on derivatives procedure. The Master Curve is smoothed
    by B-splines basis. The package output is composed of plots of experimental data,
    horizontal and vertical shifts, TTS data, and TTS data fitted using B-splines with
    bootstrap confidence intervals.'
