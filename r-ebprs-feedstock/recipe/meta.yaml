  summary: EB-PRS is a novel method that leverages information for effect sizes across all the
    markers to improve the prediction accuracy.  No parameter tuning is needed in the
    method, and no external information is needed. This R-package provides the calculation
    of polygenic risk scores from the given training summary statistics and testing
    data. We can use EB-PRS to extract main information, estimate Empirical Bayes parameters,
    derive polygenic risk scores for  each individual in testing data, and evaluate
    the PRS according to AUC and predictive r2.
