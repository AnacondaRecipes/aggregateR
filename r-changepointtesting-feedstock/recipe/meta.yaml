  summary: A multiple testing procedure for clustered alternative hypotheses. It is assumed that
    the p-values under the null hypotheses follow U(0,1) and that the distributions
    of p-values from the alternative hypotheses are stochastically smaller than U(0,1).
    By aggregating information, this method is more sensitive to detecting signals of
    low magnitude than standard methods. Additionally, sporadic small p-values appearing
    within a null hypotheses sequence are avoided by averaging on the neighboring p-values.
