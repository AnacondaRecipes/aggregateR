  summary: Tool to print out the value of R objects/expressions while running an R script. Outputs
    can be made dependent on user-defined conditions/criteria.  Debug messages only
    appear when a global option for debugging is set.  This way, 'debugr' code can even
    remain in the debugged code for later use  without any negative effects during normal
    runtime.
