  summary: 'Based on large margin principle, this package performs feature selection methods:
    "IM4E"(Iterative Margin-Maximization under Max-Min Entropy Algorithm); "imIM4E"(imbalance
    Iterative Margin-Maximization under Max-Min Entropy Algorithm); "Immigrate"(Iterative
    Max-Min Entropy Margin-Maximization with Interaction Terms Algorithm); "BIM"(Boosted
    version of IMMIGRATE algorithm); "Simba"(Iterative Search Margin Based Algorithm);
    "LFE"(Local Feature Extraction Algorithm). This package also performs prediction
    for the above feature selection methods. See Zhao et al. (2018) <arXiv:1810.02658>
    for more details.'
