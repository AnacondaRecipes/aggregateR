  summary: A collection of functions that would help one to build features based on external
    data. Very useful for Data Scientists in data to day work. Many functions create
    features using parallel computation. Since the nitty gritty of parallel computation
    is hidden under the hood, the user need not worry about creating clusters and shutting
    them down.
