  summary: Calculates nonparametric pointwise confidence intervals for the survival distribution
    for right censored data. Has two-sample tests for dissimilarity (e.g., difference,
    ratio or odds ratio) in survival at a fixed time. Especially important for small
    sample sizes or heavily censored data. Includes mid-p options.
