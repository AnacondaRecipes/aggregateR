  summary: Decomposition of (income) inequality by population sub groups. For a decomposition
    on a single variable the mean log deviation can be used (see Mookherjee Shorrocks
    (1982) <DOI:10.2307/2232673>). For a decomposition on multiple variables a regression
    based technique can be used (see Fields (2003) <DOI:10.1016/s0147-9121(03)22001-x>).
    Recentered influence function regression for marginal effects of the (income or
    wealth) distribution  (see Firpo et al. (2009) <DOI:10.3982/ECTA6822>). Some extensions
    to inequality functions to handle weights and/or missings.
