  summary: 'Performs the two-sample comparisons using the following exact test procedures: the
    exact likelihood-ratio test (LRT) for equality of two normal populations proposed
    in Zhang et al. (2012); the combined test based on the LRT and Shapiro-Wilk test
    for normality via the Bonferroni correction technique; the newly proposed density-based
    empirical likelihood (DBEL) ratio test. To calculate p-values of the DBEL procedures,
    three procedures are used: (a) the traditional Monte Carlo (MC) method implemented
    in C++, (b) a new interpolation method based on regression techniques to operate
    with tabulated critical values of the test statistic; (c) a Bayesian type method
    that uses the tabulated critical values as the prior information and  MC generated
    DBEL-test-statistic''s values as data.'
