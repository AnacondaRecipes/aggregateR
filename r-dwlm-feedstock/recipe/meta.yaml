  summary: This linear model solution is useful when both predictor and response have associated
    uncertainty. The doubly weights linear model solution is invariant on which quantity
    is used as predictor or response. Based on the results by Reed(1989) <doi:10.1119/1.15963>
    and Ripley & Thompson(1987) <doi:10.1039/AN9871200377>.
