  summary: A general framework for the application of cross-validation schemes to particular
    functions. By allowing arbitrary lists of results, origami accommodates a range
    of cross-validation applications. This implementation was first described by Coyle
    and Hejazi (2018) <doi:10.21105/joss.00512>.
