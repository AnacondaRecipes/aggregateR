  summary: The base 'sets' tools follow the algebraic definition that each element of a set must
    be unique.  Since it's often helpful to compare all elements of two vectors, this
    toolset treats every element as unique for counting purposes. For ease of use, all
    functions in vecsets have an argument 'multiple' which, when set to FALSE, reverts
    them to the base::set tools functionality.
