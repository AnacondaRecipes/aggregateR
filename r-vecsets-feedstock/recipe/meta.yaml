  summary: The 'base'  tools  union() intersect(), etc.,  follow the algebraic definition that
    each element of a set must be unique. Since it's often helpful to compare all elements
    of two vectors, this toolset treats every element as unique for counting purposes.
    For ease of use, all functions in vecsets have an argument 'multiple' which, when
    set to FALSE, reverts them to the base::sets (alias for all the items) tools functionality.
