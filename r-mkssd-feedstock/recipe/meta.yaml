  summary: Generates efficient balanced non-aliased multi-level k-circulant supersaturated designs
    by interchanging the elements of the generator vector. Attempts to generate a supersaturated
    design that has chisquare efficiency more than user specified efficiency level (mef).
    Displays the progress of generation of an efficient multi-level k-circulant design
    through a progress bar. The progress of 100% means that one full round of interchange
    is completed. More than one full round (typically 4-5 rounds) of interchange may
    be required for larger designs.
