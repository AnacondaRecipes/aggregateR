  summary: mkssd is a package that generates efficient balanced non-aliased multi-level k-circulant
    supersaturated designs by interchanging the elements of the generator vector. The
    package tries to generate a supersaturated design that has chisquare efficiency
    more than user specified efficiency level (mef). The package also displays the progress
    of generation of an efficient multi-level k-circulant design through a progress
    bar. The progress of 100% means that one full round of interchange is completed.
    More than one full round (typically 4-5 rounds) of interchange may be required for
    larger designs.
