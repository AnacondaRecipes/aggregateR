  summary: The core of this 'Rcpp' based package is a function to compute standardized Jonckheere-Terpstra
    test statistics for large numbers of dependent and independent variables, e.g.,
    genome-wide analysis. It implements 'OpenMP', allowing the option of computing on
    multiple threads. Supporting functions are also provided to calculate p-values and
    summarize results.
