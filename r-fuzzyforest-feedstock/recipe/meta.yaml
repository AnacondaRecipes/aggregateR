  summary: Fuzzy forests, a new algorithm based on random forests, is designed to reduce the
    bias seen in random forest feature selection caused by the presence of correlated
    features.  Fuzzy forests uses recursive feature elimination random forests to select
    features from separate blocks of correlated features where the correlation within
    each block of features is high and the correlation between blocks of features is
    low. One final random forest is fit using the surviving features. This package fits
    random forests using the 'randomForest' package and allows for easy use of 'WGCNA'
    to split features into distinct blocks. See D. Conn, Ngun, T., C. Ramirez, and G.
    Li (2019) <doi:10.18637/jss.v091.i09> for further details.
