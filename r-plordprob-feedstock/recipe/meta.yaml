  summary: Multivariate ordered probit model, i.e. the extension of the scalar ordered probit
    model where the observed variables have dimension greater than one. Estimation of
    the parameters is done via maximization of the pairwise likelihood, a special case
    of the composite likelihood obtained as product of bivariate marginal distributions.
    The package uses the Fortran 77 subroutine SADMVN by Alan Genz, with minor adaptations
    made by Adelchi Azzalini in his "mvnormt" package for evaluating the two-dimensional
    Gaussian integrals involved in the pairwise log-likelihood. Optimization of the
    latter objective function  is performed via quasi-Newton box-constrained optimization
    algorithm, as implemented in nlminb.
