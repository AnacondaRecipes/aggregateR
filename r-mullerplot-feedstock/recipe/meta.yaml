  summary: Generates Muller plot from parental/genealogy/phylogeny information and population/abundance/frequency
    dynamics data. Muller plots are plots which combine information about succession
    of different OTUs (genotypes, phenotypes, species, ...) and information about dynamics
    of their abundances (populations or frequencies) over time. They are powerful and
    fascinating tools to visualize evolutionary dynamics. They may be employed also
    in study of diversity and its dynamics, i.e. how diversity emerges and how changes
    over time. They are called Muller plots in honor of Hermann Joseph Muller which
    used them to explain his idea of Muller's ratchet (Muller, 1932, American Naturalist).
    A big difference between Muller plots and normal box plots of abundances is that
    a Muller plot depicts not only the relative abundances but also succession of OTUs
    based on their genealogy/phylogeny/parental relation. In a Muller plot, horizontal
    axis is time/generations and vertical axis represents relative abundances of OTUs
    at the corresponding times/generations. Different OTUs are usually shown with polygons
    with different colors and each OTU originates somewhere in the middle of its parent
    area in order to illustrate their succession in evolutionary process. To generate
    a Muller plot one needs the genealogy/phylogeny/parental relation of OTUs and their
    abundances over time. MullerPlot package has the tools to generate Muller plots
    which clearly depict the origin of successors of OTUs.
