  summary: 'Functions are provided to facilitate prior elicitation for Bayesian generalised linear
    models using independent conditional means priors. The package supports the elicitation
    of multivariate normal priors for generalised linear models. The approach can be
    applied to indirect elicitation for a generalised linear model that is linear in
    the parameters. The package is designed such that the facilitator executes functions
    within the R console during the elicitation session to provide graphical and numerical
    feedback at each design point. Various methodologies for eliciting fractiles (equivalently,
    percentiles or quantiles) are supported, including versions of the approach of Hosack
    et al. (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.ress.2017.06.011>. For example, experts may be asked
    to provide central credible intervals that correspond to a certain probability.
    Or experts may be allowed to vary the probability allocated to the central credible
    interval for each design point. Additionally, a median may or may not be elicited. '
