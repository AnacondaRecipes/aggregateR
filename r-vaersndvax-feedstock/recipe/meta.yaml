  summary: 'Non-Domestic VAERS vaccine data for 01/01/2016 - 06/14/2016. If you want to explore
    the full VAERS data for 1990 - Present (data, symptoms, and vaccines), then check
    out the ''vaersND'' package from the URL below. The URL and BugReports below correspond
    to the ''vaersND'' package, of which ''vaersNDvax'' is a small subset (2016 only).
    ''vaersND'' is not hosted on CRAN due to the large size of the data set. To install
    the Suggested ''vaers'' and ''vaersND'' packages, use the following R code: ''devtools::install_git("https://gitlab.com/iembry/vaers.git",
    build_vignettes = TRUE)'' and ''devtools::install_git("https://gitlab.com/iembry/vaersND.git",
    build_vignettes = TRUE)''. "VAERS is a national vaccine safety surveillance program
    co-sponsored by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the
    US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). VAERS is a post-marketing safety surveillance
    program, collecting information about adverse events (possible side effects) that
    occur after the administration of vaccines licensed for use in the United States."
