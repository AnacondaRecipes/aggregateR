  summary: A programmatic interface to the web service methods provided by Global Biotic Interactions
    (GloBI) (<https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/>). GloBI provides access to
    spatial-temporal species interaction records from sources all over the world. rglobi
    provides methods to search species interactions by location, interaction type, and
    taxonomic name. In addition, it supports Cypher, a graph query language, to allow
    for executing custom queries on the GloBI aggregate species interaction data set.
