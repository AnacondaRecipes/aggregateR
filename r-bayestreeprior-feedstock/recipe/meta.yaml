  summary: Provides a way to simulate from the prior distribution of Bayesian trees by Chipman
    et al. (1998) <DOI:10.2307/2669832>. The prior distribution of Bayesian trees is
    highly dependent on the design matrix X, therefore using the suggested hyperparameters
    by Chipman et al. (1998) <DOI:10.2307/2669832> is not recommended and could lead
    to unexpected prior distribution. This work is part of my master thesis (expected
    2016).
