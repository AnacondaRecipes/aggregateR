  summary: Estimation of multivariate normal (MVN) and student-t data of arbitrary dimension
    where the pattern of missing data is monotone. See Pantaleo and Gramacy (2010) <arXiv:0907.2135>.
    Through the use of parsimonious/shrinkage regressions (plsr, pcr, lasso, ridge,  etc.),
    where standard regressions fail, the package can handle a nearly arbitrary amount
    of missing data. The current version supports maximum likelihood inference and a
    full Bayesian approach employing scale-mixtures for Gibbs sampling. Monotone data
    augmentation extends this Bayesian approach to arbitrary missingness patterns.  A
    fully functional standalone interface to the Bayesian lasso (from Park & Casella),
    Normal-Gamma (from Griffin & Brown), Horseshoe (from Carvalho, Polson, & Scott),
    and ridge regression with model selection via Reversible Jump, and student-t errors
    (from Geweke) is also provided.
