  summary: Assessment of habitat selection by means of the permutation-based combination of sign
    tests (Fattorini et al., 2014 <DOI:10.1007/s10651-013-0250-7>). To exemplify the
    application of this procedure, habitat selection is assessed for a population of
    European Brown Hares settled in central Italy.
