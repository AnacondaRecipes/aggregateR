  summary: Interpreted interface between 'GRASS' 7 geographical  information system and R, based
    on starting R from within the 'GRASS' 'GIS' environment, or running free-standing
    R in a temporary 'GRASS' location; the package provides facilities for using all
    'GRASS' commands from the  R command line. This package may not be used for 'GRASS'
    6, for which 'spgrass6' should be used.
