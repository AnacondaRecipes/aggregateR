  summary: Implementation of 'softmax' regression and classification models with multiple layer
    neural network. It can be used for many tasks like word embedding based document
    classification, 'MNIST' dataset handwritten digit recognition and so on. Multiple
    optimization algorithm including 'SGD', 'Adagrad', 'RMSprop', 'Moment', 'NAG', etc
    are also provided.
