  summary: Model-based clustering and identifying informative features based on regularization
    methods. The package includes three regularization methods - PAirwise Reciprocal
    fuSE (PARSE) penalty proposed by Wang, Zhou and Hoeting (2016), the adaptive L1
    penalty (APL1) and the adaptive pairwise fusion penalty (APFP). Heatmaps are included
    to shown the identification of informative features.
