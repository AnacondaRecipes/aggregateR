  summary: An estimation method that can use computer simulations to approximate maximum-likelihood
    estimates even when the likelihood function can not be evaluated directly. It can
    be applied whenever it is feasible to conduct many simulations, but works best when
    the data is approximately Poisson distributed. It was originally designed for demographic
    inference in evolutionary biology (Naduvilezhath et al., 2011 <doi:10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05131.x>,
    Mathew et al., 2013 <doi:10.1002/ece3.722>). It has optional support for conducting
    coalescent simulation using the 'coala' package.
