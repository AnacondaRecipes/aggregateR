  summary: This is a shape preserving spline <doi:10.1137/0720057> which is guaranteed to be
    monotonic and concave or convex if the data is monotonic and concave or convex.
    It does not use any  optimisation and is therefore quick and smoothly converges
    to a  fixed point in economic dynamics problems including value function  iteration.
    It also automatically gives the first two derivatives  of the spline and options
    for determining behaviour when evaluated  outside the interpolation domain.
