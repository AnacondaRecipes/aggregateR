  summary: Implements functions and instruments for regression model building and its application
    to forecasting. The main scope of the package is in variables selection and models
    specification for cases of time series data. This includes promotional modelling,
    selection between different dynamic regressions with non-standard distributions
    of errors, selection based on cross validation, solutions to the fat regression
    model problem and more. Models developed in the package are tailored specifically
    for forecasting purposes. So as a results there are several methods that allow producing
    forecasts from these models and visualising them.
