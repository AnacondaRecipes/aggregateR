  summary: 'Provides functions to read data from neuroimaging files in ''FreeSurfer'' <http://freesurfer.net/>
    binary formats. This includes the following file formats: 1) MGH/MGZ format files,
    which can contain multi-dimensional images or other data. Typically they contain
    time-series of three-dimensional brain scans acquired by magnetic resonance imaging
    (MRI). They can also contain vertex-wise measures of surface morphometry data. The
    MGH format is named after the Massachusetts General Hospital, and the MGZ format
    is a compressed version of the same format. 2) ''FreeSurfer'' morphometry data files
    in binary ''curv'' format. These contain vertex-wise surface measures, i.e., one
    scalar value for each vertex of a brain surface mesh. These are typically values
    like the cortical thickness or brain surface area at each vertex.'
