  summary: 'Provides functions to read and write neuroimaging data in various file formats, with
    a focus on ''FreeSurfer'' <http://freesurfer.net/> formats. This includes, but is
    not limited to, the following file formats: 1) MGH/MGZ format files, which can contain
    multi-dimensional images or other data. Typically they contain time-series of three-dimensional
    brain scans acquired by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They can also contain
    vertex-wise measures of surface morphometry data. The MGH format is named after
    the Massachusetts General Hospital, and the MGZ format is a compressed version of
    the same format. 2) ''FreeSurfer'' morphometry data files in binary ''curv'' format.
    These contain vertex-wise surface measures, i.e., one scalar value for each vertex
    of a brain surface mesh. These are typically values like the cortical thickness
    or brain surface area at each vertex. 3) Annotation file format. This contains a
    brain surface parcellation derived from a cortical atlas. 4) Surface file format.
    Contains a brain surface mesh, given by a list of vertices and a list of faces.'
