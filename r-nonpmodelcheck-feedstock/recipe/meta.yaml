  summary: Provides tests of significance for covariates (or groups of covariates) in a fully
    nonparametric regression model and a variable (or group) selection procedure based
    on False Discovery Rate. In addition, it provides a function for local polynomial
    regression for any number of dimensions, using a bandwidth specified by the user
    or automatically chosen by cross validation or an adaptive procedure.
