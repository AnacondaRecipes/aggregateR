  summary: 'Provides stochastic EM algorithms for latent variable models with a high-dimensional
    latent space. So far, we provide functions for confirmatory item factor analysis
    based on the multidimensional two parameter logistic (M2PL) model and the generalized
    multidimensional partial credit model. These functions scale well for problems with
    many latent traits (e.g., thirty or even more) and are virtually tuning-free. The
    computation is facilitated by multiprocessing ''OpenMP'' API. For more information,

    Algorithm for Large-scale Full-information Item Factor Analysis. British Journal
