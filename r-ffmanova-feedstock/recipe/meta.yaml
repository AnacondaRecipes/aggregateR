  summary: General linear modeling with multiple responses (MANCOVA). An overall p-value for
    each model term is calculated by the 50-50 MANOVA method by Langsrud (2002) <doi:10.1111/1467-9884.00320>,
    which handles collinear responses. Rotation testing, described by Langsrud (2005)
    <doi:10.1007/s11222-005-4789-5>, is used to compute adjusted single response p-values
    according to familywise error rates and false discovery rates (FDR). The approach
    to FDR is described in the appendix of Moen et al. (2005) <doi:10.1128/AEM.71.4.2086-2094.2005>.
    Unbalanced designs are handled by Type II sums of squares as argued in Langsrud
    (2003) <doi:10.1023/A:1023260610025>. Furthermore, the Type II philosophy is extended
    to continuous design variables as described in Langsrud et al. (2007) <doi:10.1080/02664760701594246>.
    This means that the method is invariant to scale changes and that common pitfalls
    are avoided.
