  summary: 'Provides functions that performs popular stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo
    (SGMCMC) methods on user specified models. The required gradients are automatically
    calculated using ''TensorFlow'' <https://www.tensorflow.org/>, an efficient library
    for numerical computation. This means only the log likelihood and log prior functions
    need to be specified. The methods implemented include stochastic gradient Langevin
    dynamics (SGLD), stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC), stochastic
    gradient Nose-Hoover thermostat (SGNHT) and their respective control variate versions
    for increased efficiency. References: M. Welling, Y. W. Teh (2011) <http://www.icml-2011.org/papers/398_icmlpaper.pdf>;
