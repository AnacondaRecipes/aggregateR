  summary: Applies local log-linear capture-recapture models (LLLMs) for closed populations,
    as described in the doctoral thesis of Zachary Kurtz. The method is relevant when
    there are 3-5 capture occasions, with auxiliary covariates available for all capture
    occasions.  As part of estimating the number of missing population units, the method
    estimates the "rate of missingness" as it varies over the covariate space.  In addition,
    user-friendly functions are provided to recreate (approximately) the method of Zwane
    and van der Heijden (2004), which applied the VGAM package in a way that is closely
    related to LLLMs.
