  summary: Functions for exploring and visualising estimation results obtained with BayesX, a
    free software for estimating structured additive regression models (<https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/bayesx/550513.html>).
    In addition, functions that allow to read, write and manipulate map objects that
    are required in spatial analyses performed with BayesX.
