  license: MIT
  summary: An implementation of Jon Kleinberg's burst detection algorithm (Kleinberg (2003) <doi:10.1023/A:1024940629314>).  Uses
    an infinite Markov model to detect periods of increased activity in a series of
    discrete events with known times, and provides a simple visualization of the results.
