  summary: 'Consider linear regression model Y = Xb + error where the distribution function of
    errors is unknown, but errors are independent and symmetrically distributed. The
    package contains a function named LRMDE which takes Y and X as input and returns
    minimum distance estimator of parameter b in the model. '
