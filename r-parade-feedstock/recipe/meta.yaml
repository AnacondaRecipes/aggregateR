  summary: 'Tool for producing Pen''s parade graphs, useful for visualizing inequalities in income,
    wages or other variables, as proposed by Pen (1971, ISBN: 978-0140212594). Income
    or another economic variable is captured by the vertical axis, while the population
    is arranged in ascending order of income along the horizontal axis. Pen''s income
    parades provide an easy-to-interpret visualization of economic inequalities.'
