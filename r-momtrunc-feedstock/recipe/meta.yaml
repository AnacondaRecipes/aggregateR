  summary: It computes arbitrary products moments (mean vector and variance-covariance matrix),
    for some double truncated (and folded) multivariate distributions. These distributions
    belong to the family of selection elliptical distributions, which includes well
    known skewed distributions as the unified skew-t distribution (SUT) and its particular
    cases as the extended skew-t (EST), skew-t (ST) and the symmetric student-t (T)
    distribution. Analogous normal cases unified skew-normal (SUN), extended skew-normal
    (ESN), skew-normal (SN), and symmetric normal (N) are also included. Density, probabilities
    and random deviates are also offered for these members.
