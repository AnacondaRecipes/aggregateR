  summary: MCMC diagnostic package that contains tools to diagnose convergence as well as to
    evaluate sensitivity studies, Includes summary functions which output mean, median,
    95percentCI, Gelman & Rubin diagnostics and the Hellinger distance based diagnostics,
    Also contains functions to determine when an MCMC chain has converged via Hellinger
    distance, A function is also provided to compare outputs from identically dimensioned
    chains for determining sensitivy to prior distribution assumptions
