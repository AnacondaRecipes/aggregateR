  summary: Select sampling methods for probability samples using large data sets.  This includes
    spatially balanced sampling in multi-dimensional spaces with any prescribed inclusion
    probabilities. All implementations are written in C with efficient data structures
    such as k-d trees that easily scale to several million rows on a modern desktop
    computer.
