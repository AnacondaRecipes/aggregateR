  summary: "Complex machine learning models are often hard to interpret. However, in many situations
    it is crucial to understand and explain why a model made a specific prediction.
    Shapley values is the only method for such prediction explanation framework with
    a solid theoretical foundation. Previously known methods for estimating the Shapley
    values do, however, assume feature independence. This package implements the method
    described in Aas, Jullum and L\xF8land (2019) <arXiv:1903.10464>, which accounts
    for any feature dependence, and thereby produces more accurate estimates of the
    true Shapley values."

# Title: Prediction Explanation with Dependence-Aware Shapley Values
# Description: Complex machine learning models are often hard to interpret. However, in many situations it is crucial to understand and explain why a model made a specific prediction. Shapley values is the only method for such prediction explanation framework with a solid theoretical foundation. Previously known methods for estimating the Shapley values do, however, assume feature independence. This package implements the method described in Aas, Jullum and Lland (2019) <arXiv:1903.10464>, which accounts for any feature dependence, and thereby produces more accurate estimates of the true Shapley values.
