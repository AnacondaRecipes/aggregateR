  summary: Functions to calculate several ecological indices of individual and population niche
    width (Araujo's E, clustering and pairwise similarity among individuals, IS, Petraitis'
    W, and Roughgarden's WIC/TNW) to assess individual specialization based on data
    of resource use. Resource use can be quantified by counts of categories, measures
    of mass/lenght or proportions. Monte Carlo resampling procedures are available for
    hypothesis testing against multinomial null models.
