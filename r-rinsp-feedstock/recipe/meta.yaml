  summary: Functions to calculate several ecological indices of individual and population niche
    width (Araujo's E, clustering and pairwise similarity among individuals, IS, Petraitis'
    W, and Roughgarden's WIC/TNW) to assess individual specialization based on data
    of resource use. Resource use can be quantified by counts of categories, measures
    of mass or length, or proportions. Monte Carlo resampling procedures are available
    for hypothesis testing against multinomial null models. Details are provided in
    Zaccarelli et al. (2013) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12079> and associated references.
