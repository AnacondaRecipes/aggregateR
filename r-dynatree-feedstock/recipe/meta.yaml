  summary: Inference by sequential Monte Carlo for  dynamic tree regression and classification
    models with hooks provided for sequential design and optimization,  fully online
    learning with drift, variable selection, and  sensitivity analysis of inputs.  Illustrative  examples
    from the original dynamic trees paper are facilitated by demos in the package; see
    demo(package="dynaTree").
