  summary: Inference by sequential Monte Carlo for dynamic tree regression and classification
    models with hooks provided for sequential design and optimization, fully online
    learning with drift, variable selection, and sensitivity analysis of inputs.  Illustrative
    examples from the original dynamic trees paper (Gramacy, Taddy & Polson (2011);
    <doi:10.1198/jasa.2011.ap09769>) are facilitated by demos in the package; see demo(package="dynaTree").
