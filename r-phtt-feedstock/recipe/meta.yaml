  summary: 'The package provides estimation procedures for panel data with large dimensions n,
    T, and general forms of unobservable heterogeneous effects. Particularly, the estimation
    procedures are those of Bai (2009) and Kneip, Sickles, and Song (2012), which complement
    one another very well: both models assume the unobservable heterogeneous effects
    to have a factor structure. The method of Bai (2009) assumes that the factors are
    stationary, whereas the method of Kneip et al. (2012) allows the factors to be non-stationary.
    Additionally, the ''phtt'' package provides a wide range of dimensionality criteria
    in order to estimate the number of the unobserved factors simultaneously with the
    remaining model parameters.'
