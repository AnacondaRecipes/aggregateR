  summary: Calculates sample size and dose allocation for binary toxicity  tests, using the Fish
    Embryo Toxicity Test as example.  An optimal test design is obtained by running  (i)
    spoD (calculate the number of individuals to test under control  conditions), (ii)
    setD (estimate the minimal sample size per treatment given the users precision requirements)
    and (iii) doseD (construct  an individual dose scheme).
