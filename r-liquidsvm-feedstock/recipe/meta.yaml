  summary: 'Support vector machines (SVMs) and related kernel-based learning algorithms are a
    well-known class of machine learning algorithms, for non-parametric classification
    and regression. liquidSVM is an implementation of SVMs whose key features are: fully
    integrated hyper-parameter selection, extreme speed on both small and large data
    sets, full flexibility for experts, and inclusion of a variety of different learning
    scenarios: multi-class classification, ROC, and Neyman-Pearson learning, and least-squares,
    quantile, and expectile regression.'
