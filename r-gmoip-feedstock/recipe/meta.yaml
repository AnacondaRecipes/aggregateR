  summary: Make 2D and 3D plots of linear programming (LP), integer linear programming (ILP),
    or mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models with up to three objectives. Plots
    of both the solution and criterion space are possible. For instance the non-dominated
    (Pareto) set for bi-objective LP/ILP/MILP programming models (see vignettes for
    an overview). The package also contains an function for checking if a point is inside
    the convex hull.
