  summary: Implements the whitening methods (ZCA, PCA, Cholesky, ZCA-cor, and PCA-cor) discussed
    in Kessy, Lewin, and Strimmer (2018) "Optimal whitening and decorrelation", <doi:10.1080/00031305.2016.1277159>,
    as well as the whitening approach to canonical correlation analysis allowing negative
    canonical correlations described in Jendoubi and Strimmer (2019) "A whitening approach
    to probabilistic canonical correlation analysis for omics data integration", <doi:10.1186/s12859-018-2572-9>.
    The package also offers functions to simulate random orthogonal matrices, compute
    (correlation) loadings and explained variation. It also contains four example data
    sets (extended UCI wine data, TCGA LUSC data, nutrimouse data, extended pitprops
    data).
