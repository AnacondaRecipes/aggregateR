  summary: Simultaneous tests and confidence intervals are provided for one-way experimental
    designs with one or many normally distributed, primary response variables (endpoints).
    Differences (Hasler and Hothorn, 2011 <doi:10.2202/1557-4679.1258>) or ratios (Hasler
    and Hothorn, 2012 <doi:10.1080/19466315.2011.633868>) of means can be considered.
    Various contrasts can be chosen, unbalanced sample sizes are allowed as well as
    heterogeneous variances (Hasler and Hothorn, 2008 <doi:10.1002/bimj.200710466>)
    or covariance matrices (Hasler, 2014 <doi:10.1515/ijb-2012-0015>).
