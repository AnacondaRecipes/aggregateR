  summary: Fits ordinal regression models with elastic net penalty. Supported model families
    include cumulative probability, stopping ratio,  continuation ratio, and adjacent
    category. These families are a subset of  vector glm's which belong to a model class
    we call the elementwise link  multinomial-ordinal (ELMO) class. Each family in this
    class links a vector  of covariates to a vector of class probabilities. Each of
    these families  has a parallel form, which is appropriate for ordinal response data,
    as  well as a nonparallel form that is appropriate for an unordered categorical
    response, or as a more flexible model for ordinal data. The parallel model has a
    single set of coefficients, whereas the nonparallel model has a set of coefficients
    for each response category except the baseline category. It is  also possible to
    fit a model with both parallel and nonparallel terms, which  we call the semi-parallel
    model. The semi-parallel model has the flexibility  of the nonparallel model, but
    the elastic net penalty shrinks it toward the  parallel model. For details, refer
    to Wurm, Hanlon, and Rathouz (2017)  <arXiv:1706.05003>.
