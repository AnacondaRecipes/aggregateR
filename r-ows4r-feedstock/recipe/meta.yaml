  summary: Provides an Interface to Web-Services defined as standards by the Open Geospatial
    Consortium (OGC), including Web Feature Service (WFS) for vector data, Web Coverage
    Service (WCS), Catalogue Service (CSW) for ISO/OGC metadata, Web Processing Service
    (WPS) for data processes, and associated standards such as the common web-service
    specification (OWS) and OGC Filter Encoding. Partial support is provided for the
    Web Map Service (WMS). The purpose is to add support for additional OGC service
    standards such as Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS), the Sensor Observation
    Service (SOS), or even new standard services emerging such OGC API or SensorThings.
