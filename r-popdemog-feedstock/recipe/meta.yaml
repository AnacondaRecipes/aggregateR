  summary: 'Plot demographic graphs for single/multiple populations from coalescent simulation
    program input. Currently, this package can support the ''ms'', ''msHot'', ''MaCS'',
    ''msprime'', ''SCRM'', and ''Cosi2'' simulation programs. It does not check the
    simulation program input for correctness, but assumes the simulation program input
    has been validated by the simulation program. More features will be added to this
    package in the future, please check the ''GitHub'' page for the latest updates:
