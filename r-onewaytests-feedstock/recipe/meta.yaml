  summary: Performs one-way tests in independent groups designs including homoscedastic and heteroscedastic
    tests. These are one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Welch's heteroscedastic F
    test, Welch's heteroscedastic F test with trimmed means and Winsorized variances,
    Brown-Forsythe test, Alexander-Govern test, James second order test, Kruskal-Wallis
    test, Scott-Smith test, Box F test, Johansen F test, Generalized tests equivalent
    to Parametric Bootstrap and Fiducial tests, Alvandi's F test, Alvandi's generalized
    p-value, approximate F test, B square test, Cochran test, Weerahandi's generalized
    F test, modified Brown-Forsythe test, adjusted Welch's heteroscedastic F test, Welch-Aspin
    test, Permutation F test. The package performs pairwise comparisons and graphical
    approaches. Also, the package includes Student's t test, Welch's t test and Mann-Whitney
    U test for two samples. Moreover, it assesses variance homogeneity and normality
    of data in each group via tests and plots (Dag et al., 2018, <https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018/RJ-2018-022/RJ-2018-022.pdf>).
