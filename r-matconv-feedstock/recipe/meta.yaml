  summary: Transferring over a code base from Matlab to R is often a repetitive and inefficient
    use of time. This package provides a translator for Matlab / Octave code into R
    code. It does some syntax changes, but most of the heavy lifting is in the function
    changes since the languages are so similar. Options for different data structures
    and the functions that can be changed are given. The Matlab code should be mostly
    in adherence to the standard style guide but some effort has been made to accommodate
    different number of spaces and other small syntax issues. This will not make the
    code more R friendly and may not even run afterwards. However, the rudimentary syntax,
    base function and data structure conversion is done quickly so that the maintainer
    can focus on changes to the design structure.
