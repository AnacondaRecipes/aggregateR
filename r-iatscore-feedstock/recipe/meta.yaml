  summary: "This minimalist package is designed to quickly score raw data outputted from an Implicit
    Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998) <doi:10.1037/0022-3514.74.6.1464>.
    IAT scores are calculated as specified by Greenwald, Nosek, and Banaji (2003) <doi:10.1037/0022-3514.85.2.197>.
    Outputted values can be interpreted as effect sizes. The input function consists
    of three arguments. First, indicate the name of the dataset to be analyzed. This
    is the only required input. Second, indicate the number of trials in your entire
    IAT (the default is set to 219, which is typical for most IATs). Last, indicate
    whether congruent trials (e.g., flowers and pleasant) or incongruent trials (e.g.,
    guns and pleasant) were presented first for this participant (the default is set
    to congruent). The script will tell you how long it took to run the code, the effect
    size for the participant, and whether that participant should be excluded based
    on the criteria outlined by Greenwald et al. (2003). Data files should consist of
    six columns organized in order as follows: Block (0-6), trial (0-19 for training
    blocks, 0-39 for test blocks), category (dependent on your IAT), the type of item
    within that category (dependent on your IAT), a dummy variable indicating whether
    the participant was correct or incorrect on that trial (0=correct, 1=incorrect),
    and the participant\u2019s reaction time (in milliseconds). Three sample datasets
    are included in this package (labeled 'IAT', 'TooFastIAT', and 'BriefIAT') to practice
    with."
