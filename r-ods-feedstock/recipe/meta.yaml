  summary: 'Outcome-dependent sampling (ODS) schemes are cost-effective ways to enhance study
    efficiency.  In ODS designs, one observes the exposure/covariates with a probability
    that depends on the outcome  variable. Popular ODS designs include case-control
    for binary outcome, case-cohort for time-to-event  outcome, and continuous outcome
    ODS design (Zhou et al. 2002) <doi: 10.1111/j.0006-341X.2002.00413.x>.  Because
    ODS data has biased sampling nature, standard statistical analysis such as linear
    regression  will lead to biases estimates of the population parameters. This package
    implements four statistical  methods related to ODS designs: (1) An empirical likelihood
    method analyzing the primary continuous  outcome with respect to exposure variables
    in continuous ODS design (Zhou et al., 2002). (2) A partial  linear model analyzing
    the primary outcome in continuous ODS design (Zhou, Qin and Longnecker, 2011)  <doi:
    10.1111/j.1541-0420.2010.01500.x>. (3) Analyze a secondary outcome in continuous
    ODS design  (Pan et al. 2018) <doi: 10.1002/sim.7672>. (4) An estimated likelihood
    method analyzing a secondary  outcome in case-cohort data (Pan et al. 2017) <doi:
    10.1111/biom.12838>.'
