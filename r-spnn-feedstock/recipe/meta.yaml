  summary: Scale invariant version of the original PNN proposed by Specht (1990) <doi:10.1016/0893-6080(90)90049-q>
    with the added functionality of allowing for smoothing along multiple dimensions
    while accounting for covariances within the data set. It is written in the R statistical
    programming language. Given a data set with categorical variables, we use this algorithm
    to estimate the probabilities of a new observation vector belonging to a specific
    category. This type of neural network provides the benefits of fast training time
    relative to backpropagation and statistical generalization with only a small set
    of known observations.
