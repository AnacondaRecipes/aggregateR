  summary: Provides ANOCVA (ANalysis Of Cluster VAriability), a non-parametric statistical test
    to compare clustering structures with applications in functional magnetic resonance
    imaging data (fMRI). The ANOCVA allows us to compare the clustering structure of
    multiple groups simultaneously and also to identify features that contribute to
    the differential clustering.
