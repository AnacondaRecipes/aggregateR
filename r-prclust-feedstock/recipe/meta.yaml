  summary: Clustering is unsupervised and exploratory in nature. Yet, it can be performed through
    penalized regression with grouping pursuit. In this package, we provide two algorithms
    for fitting the penalized regression-based clustering (PRclust) with non-convex
    grouping penalties, such as group truncated lasso, MCP and SCAD. One algorithm is
    based on quadratic penalty and difference convex method. Another algorithm is based
    on difference convex and ADMM, called DC-ADD, which is more efficient. Generalized
    cross validation and stability based method were provided to select the tuning parameters.
    Rand index, adjusted Rand index and Jaccard index were provided to estimate the
    agreement between estimated cluster memberships and the truth.
