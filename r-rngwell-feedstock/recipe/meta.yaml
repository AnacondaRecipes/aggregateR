  summary: It is a dedicated package to WELL pseudo random generators, which were introduced
    in Panneton et al. (2006), ``Improved Long-Period Generators Based on Linear Recurrences
    Modulo 2'', ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software. But this package is not intended
    to be used directly, you are strongly __encouraged__ to use the 'randtoolbox' package,
    which depends on this package.
