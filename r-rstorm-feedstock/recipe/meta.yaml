  summary: 'While streaming processing provides opportunities to deal with extremely large and
    ever growing data sets in (near) real time, the development of streaming algorithms
    for complex models is often cumbersome: the software packages that facilitate streaming
    processing in production environments do not provide statisticians with the simulation,
    estimation, and plotting tools they are used to. Developers of streaming algorithms
    would thus benefit from the flexibility of [R] to create, plot and compute data
    while developing streaming algorithms. Package RStorm implements a streaming architecture
    modeled on Storm for easy development and testing of streaming algorithms in [R].
    RStorm is not intended as a production package, but rather a development tool for
    streaming algorithms. '
