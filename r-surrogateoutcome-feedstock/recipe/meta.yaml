  summary: Provides functions to estimate the proportion of treatment effect on a censored primary
    outcome that is explained by the treatment effect on a censored surrogate outcome/event.
    All methods are described in detail in "Assessing the Value of a Censored Surrogate
    Outcome" by Parast L, Tian L, and Cai T which is currently in press at Lifetime
    Data Analysis. The main functions are (1) R.q.event() which calculates the proportion
    of the treatment effect (the difference in restricted mean survival time at time
    t) explained by surrogate outcome information observed up to a selected landmark
    time, (2) R.t.estimate() which calculates the proportion of the treatment effect
    explained by primary outcome information only observed up to a selected landmark
    time, and (3) IV.event() which calculates the incremental value of the surrogate
    outcome information.
