  summary: 'Conduct a noncompartmental analysis as closely as possible to the most widely used
    commercial software for pharmacokinetic analysis, i.e. ''Phoenix(R) WinNonlin(R)''
    <https://www.certara.com/software/pkpd-modeling-and-simulation/phoenix-winnonlin/>.
    Some features are 1) Use of CDISC SDTM terms 2) Automatic slope selection with the
    same criterion of WinNonlin(R) 3) Supporting both ''linear-up linear-down'' and
    ''linear-up log-down'' method 4) Interval(partial) AUCs with ''linear'' or ''log''
    interpolation method * Reference: Gabrielsson J, Weiner D. Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic
    Data Analysis - Concepts and Applications. 5th ed. 2016. (ISBN:9198299107).'
