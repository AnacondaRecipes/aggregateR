  summary: 'Statistical distribution in OOP (Object Oriented Programming) way. This package proposes
    a R6 class interface to classic statistical distribution, and new distributions
    can be easily added with the class AbstractDist. A useful point is the generic fit()
    method for each class, which uses a maximum likelihood estimation to find the parameters
    of a dataset, see, e.g. Hastie, T. and al (2009) <isbn:978-0-387-84857-0>. Furthermore,
    the rv_histogram class gives a non-parametric fit, with the same accessors that
    for the classic distribution. Finally, three random generators useful to build synthetic
    data are given: a multivariate normal generator, an orthogonal matrix generator,
    and a symmetric positive definite matrix generator, see Mezzadri, F. (2007) <arXiv:math-ph/0609050>.'
