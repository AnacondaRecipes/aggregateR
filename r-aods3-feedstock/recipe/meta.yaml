  summary: Provides functions to analyse overdispersed counts or proportions.  These functions
    should be considered as complements to more sophisticated methods such as generalized
    estimating equations (GEE) or generalized linear mixed effect models (GLMM). aods3
    is an S3 re-implementation of the deprecated S4 package aod.
