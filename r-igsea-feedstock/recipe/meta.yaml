  summary: To integrate multiple GSEA studies, we propose a hybrid strategy, iGSEA-AT, for choosing
    random effects (RE) versus fixed effect (FE) models, with an attempt to achieve
    the potential maximum statistical efficiency as well as stability in performance
    in various practical situations. In addition to iGSEA-AT, this package also provides
    options to perform integrative GSEA with testing based on a FE model (iGSEA-FE)
    and testing based on a RE model (iGSEA-RE). The approaches account for different
    set sizes when testing a database of gene sets. The function is easy to use, and
    the three approaches can be applied to both binary and continuous phenotypes.
