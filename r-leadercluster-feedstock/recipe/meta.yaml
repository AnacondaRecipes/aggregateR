  summary: The leader clustering algorithm provides a means for clustering a set of data points.
    Unlike many other clustering algorithms it does not require the user to specify
    the number of clusters, but instead requires the approximate radius of a cluster
    as its primary tuning parameter. The package provides a fast implementation of this
    algorithm in n-dimensions using Lp-distances (with special cases for p=1,2, and
    infinity) as well as for spatial data using the Haversine formula, which takes latitude/longitude
    pairs as inputs and clusters based on great circle distances.
