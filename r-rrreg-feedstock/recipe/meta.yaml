  summary: "Univariate and multivariate methods to analyze randomized response (RR) survey designs
    (e.g., Warner, S. L. (1965). Randomized response: A survey technique for eliminating
    evasive answer bias. Journal of the American Statistical Association, 60, 63\u201369,
    <doi:10.2307/2283137>). Besides univariate estimates of true proportions, RR variables
    can be used for correlations, as dependent variable in a logistic regression (with
    or without random effects), or as predictors in a linear regression (Heck, D. W.,
    & Moshagen, M. (2018). RRreg: An R package for correlation and regression analyses
    of randomized response data. Journal of Statistical Software, 85(2), 1\u201329,
    <doi:10.18637/jss.v085.i02>). For simulations and the estimation of statistical
    power, RR data can be generated according to several models. The implemented methods
    also allow to test the link between continuous covariates and dishonesty in cheating
    paradigms such as the coin-toss or dice-roll task (Moshagen, M., & Hilbig, B. E.
    (2017). The statistical analysis of cheating paradigms. Behavior Research Methods,
    49, 724\u2013732, <doi:10.3758/s13428-016-0729-x>)."
