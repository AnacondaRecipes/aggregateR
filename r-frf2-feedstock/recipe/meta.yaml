  summary: Regular and non-regular Fractional Factorial 2-level designs can be created. Furthermore,
    analysis tools for Fractional Factorial designs with 2-level factors are offered
    (main effects and interaction plots for all factors simultaneously, cube plot for
    looking at the simultaneous effects of three factors, full or half normal plot,
    alias structure in a more readable format than with the built-in function alias).
