  summary: 'Contains two main functions: one for solving general isotone regression problems
    using the pool-adjacent-violators algorithm (PAVA); another one provides a framework
    for active set methods for isotone optimization problems with arbitrary order restrictions.
    Various types of loss functions are prespecified.'
