  summary: Using any importation code designed for 'SAS' users to read ASCII files into 'sas7bdat'
    files, this package parses through the INPUT block of a '.sas' syntax file to design
    the parameters needed for a 'read.fwf()' function call.  This allows the user to
    specify the location of the ASCII (often a '.dat') file and the location of the
    'SAS' syntax file, and then load the data frame directly into R in just one step.
