  summary: A nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm based on the echolocation behavior of microbats
    that uses frequency tuning to optimize problems in both continuous and discrete
    dimensions. This R package makes it easy to implement the standard bat algorithm
    on any user-supplied function. The algorithm was first developed by Xin-She Yang
    in 2010 (<DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-12538-6_6>, <DOI:10.1109/CINTI.2014.7028669>).
