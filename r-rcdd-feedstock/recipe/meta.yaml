  summary: 'R interface to (some of) cddlib (<https://github.com/cddlib/cddlib>). Converts back
    and forth between two representations of a convex polytope: as solution of a set
    of linear equalities and inequalities and as convex hull of set of points and rays.
    Also does linear programming and redundant generator elimination (for example, convex
    hull in n dimensions).  All functions can use exact infinite-precision rational
    arithmetic.'
