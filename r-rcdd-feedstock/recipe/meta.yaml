  summary: 'R interface to (some of) cddlib (<http://www.ifor.math.ethz.ch/~fukuda/cdd_home/cdd.html>).
    Converts back and forth between two representations of a convex polytope: as solution
    of a set of linear equalities and inequalities and as convex hull of set of points
    and rays. Also does linear programming and redundant generator elimination (for
    example, convex hull in n dimensions).  All functions can use exact infinite-precision
    rational arithmetic.'
