  summary: Quickly run experiments to compare the run time and output of code blocks. The function
    mbc() can make fast comparisons of code, and will calculate statistics comparing
    the resulting outputs. It can be used to compare model fits to the same data or
    see which function runs faster. The function ffexp() runs a function using all possible
    combinations of selected inputs. This is useful for comparing the effect of different
    parameter values. It can also run in parallel and automatically save intermediate
    results, which is very useful for long computations.
