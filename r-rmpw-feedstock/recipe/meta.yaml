  summary: We implement causal mediation analysis using the methods proposed by Hong (2010) and
    Hong, Deutsch & Hill (2015) <doi:10.3102/1076998615583902>. It allows the estimation
    and hypothesis testing of causal mediation effects through ratio of mediator probability
    weights (RMPW). This strategy conveniently relaxes the assumption of no treatment-by-mediator
    interaction while greatly simplifying the outcome model specification without invoking
    strong distributional assumptions. We also implement a sensitivity analysis by extending
    the RMPW method to assess potential bias in the presence of omitted pretreatment
    or posttreatment covariates. The sensitivity analysis strategy was proposed by Hong,
    Qin, and Yang (2018) <doi:10.3102/1076998617749561>.
