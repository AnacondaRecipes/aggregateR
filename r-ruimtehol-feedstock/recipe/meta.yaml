  summary: 'Wraps the ''StarSpace'' library <https://github.com/facebookresearch/StarSpace> allowing
    users to calculate word, sentence, article, document, webpage, link and entity ''embeddings''.
    By using the ''embeddings'', you can perform text based multi-label classification,
    find similarities between texts and categories, do collaborative-filtering based
    recommendation as well as content-based recommendation, find out relations between
    entities, calculate graph ''embeddings'' as well as perform semi-supervised learning
    and multi-task learning on plain text. The techniques are explained in detail in
    the paper: ''StarSpace: Embed All The Things!'' by Wu et al. (2017), available at
    <arXiv:1709.03856>.'
