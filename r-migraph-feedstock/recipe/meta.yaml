  summary: A set of tools for analysing multimodal networks. It includes functions for measuring
    centrality, centralization, cohesion, closure, constraint and diversity, as well
    as for network block-modelling, regression, and diffusion models. The package is
    released as a complement to 'Multimodal Political Networks' (2021, ISBN:9781108985000),
    and includes various datasets used in the book. Built on the 'manynet' package,
    all functions operate with matrices, edge lists, and 'igraph', 'network', and 'tidygraph'
    objects, and on one-mode, two-mode (bipartite), and sometimes three-mode networks.
