  summary: Functions for examining measurement invariance via equivalence testing along with
    adjusted RMSEA(root mean square error of approximation; Steiger & Lind, 1980) cutoff
    values. In particular, a projection-based method is implemented to test the equality
    of latent factor means across groups without assuming the equality of intercepts.
