  summary: The Dirichlet (aka NBD-Dirichlet) model describes the purchase incidence and brand
    choice of consumer products.  We estimate the model and summarize various theoretical
    quantities of interest to marketing researchers. Also provides functions for making
    tables that compare observed and theoretical statistics.
