  summary: Implements an MCMC sampler for the posterior distribution of arbitrary time-homogeneous
    multivariate stochastic differential equation (SDE) models with possibly latent
    components.  The package provides a simple entry point to integrate user-defined
    models directly with the sampler's C++ code, and parallelizes large portions of
    the calculations when compiled with 'OpenMP'.
