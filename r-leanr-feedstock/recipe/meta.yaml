  summary: 'Implements the method described in "Network-based analysis of omics data: The LEAN
    method" [Gwinner Boulday (2016) <DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw676>] Given a protein
    interaction network and a list of p-values describing a measure of interest (as
    e.g. differential gene expression) this method computes an enrichment p-value for
    the protein neighborhood of each gene and compares it to a background distribution
    of randomly drawn p-values. The resulting scores are corrected for multiple testing
    and significant hits are returned in tabular format.'
