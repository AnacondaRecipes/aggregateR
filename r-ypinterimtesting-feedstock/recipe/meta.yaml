  summary: For any spending function specified by the user, this package provides corresponding
    boundaries for interim testing using the adaptively weighted log-rank test developed
    by Yang and Prentice (2010 <doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2009.01243.x>). The package
    uses a re-sampling method to obtain stopping boundaries at the interim looks.The
    output consists of stopping boundaries and observed values of the test statistics
    at the interim looks, along with nominal p-values defined as the probability of
    the test exceeding the specific observed test statistic value or critical value,
    regardless of the test behavior at other looks. The asymptotic validity of the stopping
    boundaries is established in Yang (2018 <doi:10.1002/sim.7958>).
