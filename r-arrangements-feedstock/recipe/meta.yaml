  summary: Fast generators and iterators for permutations, combinations, integer partitions and
    compositions. The arrangements are in lexicographical order and generated iteratively
    in a memory efficient manner. It has been demonstrated that 'arrangements' outperforms
    most existing packages of similar kind. Benchmarks could be found at <https://randy3k.github.io/arrangements/articles/benchmark.html>.
