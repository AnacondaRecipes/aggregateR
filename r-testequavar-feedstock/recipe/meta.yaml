  summary: Tests the hypothesis  that variances are homogeneous or not using bootstrap. The procedure
    uses a variance-based statistic, and is derived from a normal-theory test. The test
    equivalently expressed the hypothesis as a function of the log contrasts of the
    population variances. A box-type acceptance region is constructed to test the hypothesis.
