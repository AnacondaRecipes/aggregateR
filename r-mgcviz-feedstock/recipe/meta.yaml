  summary: Extension of the 'mgcv' package, providing visual tools for Generalized Additive Models
    that exploit the additive structure of such models, scale to large data sets and
    can be used in conjunction with a wide range of response distributions. The focus
    is providing visual methods for better understanding the model output and for aiding
    model checking and development beyond simple exponential family regression. The
    graphical framework is based on the layering system provided by 'ggplot2'.
