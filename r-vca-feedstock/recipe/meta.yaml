  summary: ANOVA and REML estimation of linear mixed models is implemented, once following Searle
    et al. (1991, ANOVA for unbalanced data), once making use of the 'lme4' package.
    The primary objective of this package is to perform a variance component analysis
    (VCA) according to CLSI EP05-A3 guideline "Evaluation of Precision of Quantitative
    Measurement Procedures" (2014). There are plotting methods for visualization of
    an experimental design, plotting random effects and residuals. For ANOVA type estimation
    two methods for computing ANOVA mean squares are implemented (SWEEP and quadratic
    forms). The covariance matrix of variance components can be derived, which is used
    in estimating confidence intervals. Linear hypotheses of fixed effects and LS means
    can be computed. LS means can be computed at specific values of covariables and
    with custom weighting schemes for factor variables. See ?VCA for a more comprehensive
    description of the features.
