  summary: A forest plot that allows for multiple confidence intervals per row, custom fonts
    for each text element, custom confidence intervals, text mixed with expressions,
    and more. The aim is to extend the use of forest plots beyond meta-analyses. This
    is a more general version of the original 'rmeta' package's forestplot() function
    and relies heavily on the 'grid' package.
