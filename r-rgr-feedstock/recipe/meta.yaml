  summary: 'Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) functions for exploratory data analysis with applied
    geochemical data, with special application to the estimation of background ranges
    and identification of outliers, ''anomalies'', to support mineral exploration and
    environmental studies.  Additional functions are provided to support analytical
    data QA/QC, ANOVA for investigations of field sampling and analytical variability,
    and utility tasks.  NOTE: function caplot() for concentration-area plots employs
    package ''akima'', however, ''akima'' is only licensed for not-for-profit use.  Therefore,
    not-for-profit users of ''rgr'' will have to independently make package ''akima''
    available through library(....); and use of function caplot() by for-profit users
    will fail.'
