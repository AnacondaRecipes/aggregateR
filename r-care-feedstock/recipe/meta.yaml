  summary: 'Implements the regression approach of Zuber and Strimmer (2011) "High-dimensional
    regression and variable selection using CAR scores" SAGMB 10: 34, <DOI:10.2202/1544-6115.1730>.
    CAR scores measure the correlation between the response and the Mahalanobis-decorrelated  predictors.  The
    squared CAR score is a natural measure of variable importance and provides a canonical
    ordering of variables. This package provides functions for estimating CAR scores,
    for variable selection using CAR scores, and for estimating corresponding regression
    coefficients. Both shrinkage as well as empirical estimators are available.'
