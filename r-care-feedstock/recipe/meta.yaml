  summary: 'Implements the regression approach  of Zuber and Strimmer (2011) "High-dimensional
    regression and variable  selection using CAR scores" SAGMB 10: 34, <DOI:10.2202/1544-6115.1730>.
    CAR scores measure the correlation between the response and the  Mahalanobis-decorrelated  predictors.  The
    squared CAR score is a  natural measure of variable importance and provides a canonical  ordering
    of variables. This package provides functions for estimating  CAR scores, for variable
    selection using CAR scores, and for estimating  corresponding regression coefficients.
    Both shrinkage as well as  empirical estimators are available.'
