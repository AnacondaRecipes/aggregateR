  summary: Pure C++ implementations for reading and writing several common data formats based
    on Google protocol-buffers. Currently supports 'rexp.proto' for serialized R objects,
    'geobuf.proto' for binary geojson, and 'mvt.proto' for vector tiles. This package
    uses the auto-generated C++ code by protobuf-compiler, hence the entire serialization
    is optimized at compile time. The 'RProtoBuf' package on the other hand uses the
    protobuf runtime library to provide a general- purpose toolkit for reading and writing
    arbitrary protocol-buffer data in R.
