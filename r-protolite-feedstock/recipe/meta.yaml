  summary: Optimized C++ implementations for reading and writing protocol-buffers. Currently
    supports 'rexp.proto' for serializing R objects and 'geobuf.proto' for geojson data.
    This lightweight package is complementary to the much larger 'RProtoBuf' package
    which provides a full featured toolkit for working with protocol-buffers in R.
