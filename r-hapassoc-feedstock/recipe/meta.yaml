  summary: The following R functions are used for inference of trait associations with haplotypes
    and other covariates in generalized linear models.  The functions are developed
    primarily for data collected in cohort or cross-sectional studies. They can accommodate
    uncertain haplotype phase and handle missing genotypes at some SNPs.
