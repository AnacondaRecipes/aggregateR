  summary: 'Provides three basic functions that support an implementation of Case 2 (profile
    case) best-worst scaling. The first is to convert an orthogonal main-effect design
    into questions, the second is to create a dataset suitable for analysis, and the
    third is to calculate count-based scores. '
