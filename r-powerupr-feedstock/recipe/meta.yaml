  summary: ' Includes tools to calculate statistical power, minimum detectable effect size (MDES),
    MDES difference (MDESD), and minimum required sample size for various multilevel
    randomized experiments with continuous outcomes. Some of the functions can assist
    with planning two- and three-level cluster-randomized trials (CRTs) sensitive to
    multilevel moderation and mediation (2-1-1, 2-2-1, and 3-2-1). See ''PowerUp!''
