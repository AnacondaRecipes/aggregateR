  summary: Automated model selection and model-averaging. Provides a wrapper for glm and other
    functions, automatically generating all possible models (under constraints set by
    the user) with the specified response and explanatory variables, and finding the
    best models in terms of some Information Criterion (AIC, AICc or BIC). Can handle
    very large numbers of candidate models. Features a Genetic Algorithm to find the
    best models when an exhaustive screening of the candidates is not feasible.
