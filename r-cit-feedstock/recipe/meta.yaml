  summary: A likelihood-based hypothesis testing approach is implemented for assessing causal
    mediation. Described in Millstein, Chen, and Breton (2016), <DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw135>,
    it could be used to test for mediation of a known causal association between a DNA
    variant, the 'instrumental variable', and a clinical outcome or phenotype by gene
    expression or DNA methylation, the potential mediator. Another example would be
    testing mediation of the effect of a drug on a clinical outcome by the molecular
    target. The hypothesis test generates a p-value or permutation-based FDR value with
    confidence intervals to quantify uncertainty in the causal inference. The outcome
    can be represented by either a continuous or binary variable, the potential mediator
    is continuous, and the instrumental variable can be continuous or binary and is
    not limited to a single variable but may be a design matrix representing multiple
    variables.
