  summary: A likelihood-based hypothesis testing approach is implemented for assessing causal
    mediation. For example, it could be used to test for mediation of a known causal
    association between a DNA variant, the 'instrumental variable', and a clinical outcome
    or phenotype by gene expression or DNA methylation, the potential mediator. Another
    example would be testing mediation of the effect of a drug on a clinical outcome
    by the molecular target. The hypothesis test generates a p-value or permutation-based
    FDR value with confidence intervals to quantify uncertainty in the causal inference.
    The outcome can be represented by either a continuous or binary variable, the potential
    mediator is continuous, and the instrumental variable can be continuous or binary
    and is not limited to a single variable but may be a design matrix representing
    multiple variables.
