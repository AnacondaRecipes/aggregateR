  summary: It uses species accumulation curves and diverse estimators to assess, at the same
    time, the levels of survey coverage in multiple geographic cells of a size defined
    by the user or polygons. It also enables the geographical depiction of observed
    species richness, survey effort and completeness values including a background with
    administrative areas.
