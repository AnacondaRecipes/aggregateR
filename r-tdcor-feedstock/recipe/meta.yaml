  summary: The Time-Delay Correlation algorithm (TDCor) reconstructs the topology of a gene regulatory
    network (GRN) from time-series transcriptomic data.  The algorithm is described
    in details in Lavenus et al., Plant Cell, 2015.  It was initially developed to infer
    the topology of the GRN controlling lateral root formation in Arabidopsis thaliana.  The
    time-series transcriptomic dataset which was used in this study is included in the
    package to illustrate how to use it.
