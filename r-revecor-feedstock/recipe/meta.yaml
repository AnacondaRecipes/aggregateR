  summary: An implementation of the reverse ecology framework. Reverse ecology refers to the
    use of genomics to study ecology with no a priori assumptions about the organism(s)
    under consideration, linking organisms to their environment. It allows researchers
    to reconstruct the metabolic networks and study the ecology of poorly characterized
    microbial species from their genomic information, and has substantial potentials
    for microbial community ecological analysis.
