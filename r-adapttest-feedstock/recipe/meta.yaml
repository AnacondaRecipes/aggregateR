  summary: 'The functions defined in this program serve for implementing adaptive two-stage tests.
    Currently, four tests are included: Bauer and Koehne (1994), Lehmacher and Wassmer
    (1999), Vandemeulebroecke (2006), and the horizontal conditional error function.
    User-defined tests can also be implemented. Reference: Vandemeulebroecke, An investigation
