  summary: Provides a simple to use, intuitive, and extensible interface to several stochastic
    simulation algorithms for generating simulated trajectories of finite population
    continuous-time model. Currently it implements Gillespie's exact stochastic simulation
    algorithm (Direct method) and several approximate methods (Explicit tau-leap, Binomial
    tau-leap, and Optimized tau-leap). The package also contains a library of template
    models that can be run as demo models and can easily be customized and extended.
    Currently the following models are included, 'Decaying-Dimerization' reaction set,
    linear chain system, logistic growth model, 'Lotka' predator-prey model, Rosenzweig-MacArthur
    predator-prey model, 'Kermack-McKendrick' SIR model, and a 'metapopulation' SIRS
    model. Pineda-Krch et al. (2008) <doi:10.18637/jss.v025.i12>.
