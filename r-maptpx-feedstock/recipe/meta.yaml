  summary: Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation for topic models (i.e., Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
    in text analysis, as described in Taddy (2012) 'On estimation and selection for
    topic models'.  Previous versions of this code were included as part of the 'textir'
    package.  If you want to take advantage of openmp parallelization, uncomment the
    relevant flags in src/MAKEVARS before compiling.
