  summary: 'Provides basic functions that support an implementation of object case (Case 1) best-worst
    scaling: a function for converting a two-level orthogonal main-effect design/balanced
    incomplete block design into questions; two functions for creating a data set suitable
    for analysis; a function for calculating count-based scores; a function for calculating
    shares of preference; and a function for generating artificial responses to questions.
    For details on best-worst scaling, see Louviere et al. (2015) <doi:10.1017/CBO9781107337855>.'
