  summary: 'Provides three basic functions that support an implementation of object case (Case
    1) best-worst scaling: one for converting a two-level orthogonal main-effect design/balanced
    incomplete block design into questions; one for creating a data set suitable for
    analysis; and one for calculating count-based scores.'
