  summary: 'This package performs prediction for regression-oriented problems, aggregating in
    a nonlinear scheme any basic regression machines suggested by the context and provided
    by the user. If the user has no valuable knowledge on the data, four defaults machines
    wrappers are implemented so as to cover a minimal spectrum of prediction methods.
    If necessary, the computations may be parallelized. The method is described in Biau,
    Fischer, Guedj and Malley (2013), "COBRA: A Nonlinear Aggregation Strategy".'
