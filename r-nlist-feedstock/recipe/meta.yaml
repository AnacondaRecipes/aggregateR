  summary: Create and manipulate numeric list ('nlist') objects.  An 'nlist' is an S3 list of
    uniquely named numeric objects.  An numeric object is an integer or double vector,
    matrix or array.  An 'nlists' object is a S3 class list of 'nlist' objects with
    the same names, dimensionalities and typeofs.  Numeric list objects are of interest
    because they are the raw data inputs for analytic engines such as 'JAGS', 'STAN'
    and 'TMB'.  Numeric lists objects, which are useful for storing multiple realizations
    of of simulated data sets, can be converted to coda::mcmc and coda::mcmc.list objects.
