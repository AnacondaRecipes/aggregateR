  summary: Tools for the identification of unique of multilocus genotypes when both genotyping
    error and missing data may be present; targeted for use with large datasets and
    databases containing multiple samples of each individual (a common situation in
    conservation genetics, particularly in non-invasive wildlife sampling applications).
    Functions explicitly incorporate missing data and can tolerate allele mismatches
    created by genotyping error. If you use this package, please cite the original publication
    in Molecular Ecology Resources (Galpern et al., 2012), the details for which can
    be generated using citation('allelematch'). For a complete vignette, please access
    via the Data S1 Supplementary documentation and tutorials (PDF) located at <doi:10.1111/j.1755-0998.2012.03137.x>.
