  summary: Tools for the identification of unique of multilocus genotypes when both genotyping
    error and missing data may be present. The package is targeted at those working
    with large datasets and databases containing multiple samples of each individual,
    a situation that is common in conservation genetics, and particularly in non-invasive
    wildlife sampling applications. Functions explicitly incorporate missing data, and
    can tolerate allele mismatches created by genotyping error. If you use this tool,
    please cite the package using the journal article in Molecular Ecology Resources
    (Galpern et al., 2012). Please use citation('allelematch') to call the full citation.
    For users with access to the associated journal article, tutorial material is also
    available as supplementary material to the article describing this software, the
    citation for which can be called using citation('allelematch').
