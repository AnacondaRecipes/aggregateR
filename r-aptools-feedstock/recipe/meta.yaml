  summary: We provide tools to estimate two prediction accuracy metrics, the average positive
    predictive values (AP) as well as the well-known AUC (the area under the receiver
    operator characteristic curve) for risk scores. The outcome of interest is either
    binary or censored event time. Note that for censored event time, our functions'
    estimates, the AP and the AUC, are time-dependent for pre-specified time interval(s).
    A function that compares the APs of two risk scores/markers is also included. Optional
    outputs include positive predictive values and true positive fractions at the specified
    marker cut-off values, and a plot of the time-dependent AP versus time (available
    for event time data).
