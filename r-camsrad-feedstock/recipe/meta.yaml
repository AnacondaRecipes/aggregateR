  summary: Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) radiations service provides time series
    of global, direct, and diffuse irradiations on horizontal surface, and direct irradiation
    on normal plane for the actual weather conditions as well as for clear-sky conditions.
    The geographical coverage is the field-of-view of the Meteosat satellite, roughly
    speaking Europe, Africa, Atlantic Ocean, Middle East. The time coverage of data
    is from 2004-02-01 up to 2 days ago. Data are available with a time step ranging
    from 15 min to 1 month. For license terms and to create an account, please see <http://www.soda-pro.com/web-services/radiation/cams-radiation-service>.
