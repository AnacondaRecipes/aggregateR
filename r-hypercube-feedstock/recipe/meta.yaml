  summary: 'Provides functions and methods for organizing data in hypercubes (i.e., a multi-dimensional
    cube). Cubes are generated from molten data frames. Each cube can be manipulated
    with five operations: rotation (change.dimensionOrder()), dicing and slicing (add.selection(),
    remove.selection()), drilling down (add.aggregation()), and rolling up (remove.aggregation()).'
