  summary: Provides functions for analyzing and visualizing complex macroevolutionary dynamics
    on phylogenetic trees. It is a companion package to the command line program BAMM
    (Bayesian Analysis of Macroevolutionary Mixtures) and is entirely oriented towards
    the analysis, interpretation, and visualization of evolutionary rates. Functionality
    includes visualization of rate shifts on phylogenies, estimating evolutionary rates
    through time, comparing posterior distributions of evolutionary rates across clades,
    comparing diversification models using Bayes factors, and more.
