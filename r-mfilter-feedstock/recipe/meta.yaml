  summary: The mFilter package implements several time series filters useful for smoothing and
    extracting trend and cyclical components of a time series. The routines are commonly
    used in economics and finance, however they should also be interest to other areas.
    Currently, Christiano-Fitzgerald, Baxter-King, Hodrick-Prescott, Butterworth, and
    trigonometric regression filters are included in the package.
