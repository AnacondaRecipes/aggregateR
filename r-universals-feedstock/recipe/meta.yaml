  summary: Provides S3 generic methods and some default implementations for Bayesian analyses
    that generate Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples.  The purpose of 'universals'
    is to reduce package dependencies and conflicts.  The 'nlist' package implements
    many of the methods for its 'nlist' class.
