  summary: ' We provide tools to  (1) visualize multivariate density functions and density estimates  with
    level set trees, (2) visualize level sets with shape trees, (3) visualize multivariate
    data with tail trees,  (4) visualize scales of multivariate density estimates with  mode
    graphs and branching maps, and (5) visualize anisotropic spread with 2D volume functions
    and 2D probability content functions. Level set trees visualize mode structure,
    shape trees visualize shapes of level sets of unimodal densities, and tail trees
    visualize connected data sets. The kernel estimator is implemented but the package
    may  also be applied for visualizing other density estimates. '
