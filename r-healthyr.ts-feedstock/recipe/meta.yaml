  summary: Hospital time series data analysis workflow tools, modeling, and automations. This
    library provides many useful tools to review common administrative time series hospital
    data. Some of these include average length of stay, and readmission rates. The aim
    is to provide a simple and consistent verb framework that takes the guesswork out
    of everything.
