  summary: Provides an optimization method based on sequential quadratic programming (SQP) for
    maximum likelihood estimation of the mixture proportions in a finite mixture model
    where the component densities are known. The algorithm is expected to obtain solutions
    that are at least as accurate as the state-of-the-art MOSEK interior-point solver
    (called by function "KWDual" in the 'REBayes' package), and they are expected to
    arrive at solutions more quickly when the number of samples is large and the number
    of mixture components is not too large. This implements the "mix-SQP" algorithm,
    with some improvements, described in Y. Kim, P. Carbonetto, M. Stephens & M. Anitescu
