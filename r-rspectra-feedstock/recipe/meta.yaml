  summary: R interface to the 'Spectra' library <https://spectralib.org/> for large-scale eigenvalue
    and SVD problems. It is typically used to compute a few eigenvalues/vectors of an
    n by n matrix, e.g., the k largest eigenvalues, which is usually more efficient
    than eigen() if k << n. This package provides the 'eigs()' function that does the
    similar job as in 'Matlab', 'Octave', 'Python SciPy' and 'Julia'. It also provides
    the 'svds()' function to calculate the largest k singular values and corresponding
    singular vectors of a real matrix. The matrix to be computed on can be dense, sparse,
    or in the form of an operator defined by the user.
