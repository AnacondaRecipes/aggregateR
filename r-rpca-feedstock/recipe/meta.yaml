  summary: Suppose we have a data matrix, which is the superposition of a low-rank component
    and a sparse component. Candes, E. J., Li, X., Ma, Y., & Wright, J. (2011). Robust
    principal component analysis?. Journal of the ACM (JACM), 58(3), 11. prove that
    we can recover each component individually under some suitable assumptions. It is
    possible to recover both the low-rank and the sparse components exactly by solving
    a very convenient convex program called Principal Component Pursuit; among all feasible
    decompositions, simply minimize a weighted combination of the nuclear norm and of
    the L1 norm. This package implements this decomposition algorithm resulting with
    Robust PCA approach.
