  summary: Simulate and fitting exponential multivariate Hawkes model. This package simulates
    a multivariate Hawkes model, introduced by Hawkes (1971) <doi:10.2307/2334319>,
    with an exponential kernel and fits the parameters from the data. Models with the
    constant parameters, as well as complex dependent structures, can also be simulated
    and estimated. The estimation is based on the maximum likelihood method, introduced
    by introduced by Ozaki (1979) <doi:10.1007/BF02480272>, with 'maxLik' package.
