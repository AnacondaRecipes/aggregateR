  summary: This package performs several conventional Cross-validation statistical methods for
    climate-growth model in the climate reconstruction from tree rings, including Sign
    Test statistic, Reduction of Error statistic, Product Mean Test, Durbin-Watson statistic
    etc. This package is at its primary stage, the functions have not been tested exhaustively
    and more functions would be added in the comming days.
