  summary: A collection of functions to perform the Application Programming Interface (API) calls
    associated with the Walk Score website (www.walkscore.com) within the R environment.
    These functions can be used to query the Walk Score and Transit Score database for
    a wide variety of information using R scripts. This package includes the simple
    Walk Score and Transit Score API calls, which return the scores associated with
    an input location, as well as calls which return some data used to calculate the
    scores. These functions are especially useful for mass data collection and gathering
    Walk Score and Transit Score values for large lists of locations.
