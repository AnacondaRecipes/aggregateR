  summary: Fit the regularization path of linear, logistic or Cox models with  overlapping grouped
    covariates based on the latent group lasso approach. Latent  group MCP/SCAD as well
    as bi-level selection methods, namely the group exponential  lasso and the composite
    MCP are also available. This package serves as an  extension of R package 'grpreg'
    (by Dr. Patrick Breheny <patrick-breheny@uiowa.edu>) for grouped variable selection
    involving overlaps between groups.
