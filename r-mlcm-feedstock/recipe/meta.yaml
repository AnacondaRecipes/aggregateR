  summary: 'Conjoint measurement is a psychophysical procedure in which stimulus pairs are presented
    that vary along 2 or more dimensions and the observer is required to compare the
    stimuli along one of them.  This package contains functions to estimate the contribution
    of the n scales to the judgment by a maximum likelihood method under several hypotheses
    of how the perceptual dimensions interact. Reference: Knoblauch & Maloney (2012)
