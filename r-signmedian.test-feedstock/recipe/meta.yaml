  summary: 'Perform sign test on one-sample data, which is one of the oldest non-parametric statistical
    methods. Assume that X comes from a continuous distribution with median = v ( unknown
    ). Test the null hypothesis H0: median of X v = mu ( mu is the location parameter
    and is given in the test ) v.s. the alternative hypothesis H1: v > mu ( or v < mu
    or v != mu ) and calculate the p-value. When the sample size is large, perform the
    asymptotic sign test. In both ways, calculate the R-estimate of location of X and
    the distribution free confidence interval for mu.'
