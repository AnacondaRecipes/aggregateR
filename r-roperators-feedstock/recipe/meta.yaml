  license: MIT
  summary: Provides string arithmetic, reassignment operators, logical operators that handle
    missing values, and extra logical operators such as floating point equality and
    all or nothing. The intent is to allow R users to write code that is easier to read,
    write, and maintain while providing a friendlier experience to new R users from
    other language backgrounds (such as 'Python') who are used to concepts such as x
    += 1 and 'foo' + 'bar'.
