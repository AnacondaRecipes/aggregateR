  summary: Provides string arithmetic, reassignment operators, logical operators that handle
    missing values, and extra logical operators such as floating point equality and
    all or nothing. The intent is to allow R users to write code that is easier to read,
    write, and maintain while providing a friendlier experience to new R users from
    other language backgrounds (such as 'Python') who are used to concepts such as x
    += 1 and 'foo' + 'bar'. Includes operators for not in, easy floating point comparisons,
    === equivalent, and SQL-like like operations (), etc. We also added in some extra
    helper functions, such as OS checks, pasting in Oxford comma format, and functions
    to get the first, last, nth, or most common element of a vector or word in a string.
