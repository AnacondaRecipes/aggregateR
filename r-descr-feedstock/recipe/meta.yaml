  summary: Weighted frequency and contingency tables of categorical variables and of the comparison
    of the mean value of a numerical variable by the levels of a factor, and methods
    to produce xtable objects of the tables and to plot them. There are also functions
    to facilitate the character encoding conversion of objects, to quickly convert fixed
    width files into csv ones, and to export a data.frame to a text file with the necessary
    R and SPSS codes to reread the data.
