  summary: Functions for Arps decline-curve analysis on oil and gas data. Includes exponential,
    hyperbolic, harmonic, and hyperbolic-to-exponential models as well as the preceding
    with initial curtailment or a period of linear rate buildup. Functions included
    for computing rate, cumulative production, instantaneous decline, EUR, time to economic
    limit, and performing least-squares best fits.
