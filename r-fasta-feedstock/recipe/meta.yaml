  summary: A collection of acceleration schemes for proximal gradient methods for estimating
    penalized regression parameters described in Goldstein, Studer, and Baraniuk (2016)
    <arXiv:1411.3406>. Schemes such as Fast Iterative Shrinkage and Thresholding Algorithm
    (FISTA) by Beck and Teboulle (2009) <doi:10.1137/080716542> and the adaptive stepsize
    rule introduced in Wright, Nowak, and Figueiredo (2009) <doi:10.1109/TSP.2009.2016892>
    are included. You provide the objective function and proximal mappings, and it takes
    care of the issues like stepsize selection, acceleration, and stopping conditions
    for you.
