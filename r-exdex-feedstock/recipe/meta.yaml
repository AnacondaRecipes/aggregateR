  summary: 'Performs frequentist inference for the extremal index of a stationary time series.  Two
    types of methodology are used.  One type is based on a model that relates the distribution
    of block maxima to the marginal distribution of series and leads to the semiparametric
    maxima estimators described in Northrop (2015) <doi:10.1007/s10687-015-0221-5> and
    Berghaus and Bucher (2018) <doi:10.1214/17-AOS1621>.  Sliding block maxima are used
    to increase precision of estimation. A graphical block size diagnostic is provided.  The
    other type of methodology uses a model for the distribution of threshold inter-exceedance
    times (Ferro and Segers (2003) <doi:10.1111/1467-9868.00401>). Three versions of
    this type of approach are provided: the iterated weight least squares approach of
    Suveges (2007) <doi:10.1007/s10687-007-0034-2>, the K-gaps model of Suveges and
    Davison (2010) <doi:10.1214/09-AOAS292> and a similar approach of Holesovsky and
    Fusek (2020) <doi:10.1007/s10687-020-00374-3> that we refer to as D-gaps. For the
    K-gaps and D-gaps models this package allows missing values in the data, can accommodate
    independent subsets of data, such as monthly or seasonal time series from different
    years, and can incorporate information from right-censored inter-exceedance times.
    Graphical diagnostics for the threshold level and the respective tuning parameters
    K and D are provided.'
