  summary: Deals with many computations related to the thermodynamics of atmospheric processes.
    It includes many functions designed to consider the density of air with varying
    degrees of water vapour in it, saturation pressures and mixing ratios, conversion
    of moisture indices, computation of atmospheric states of parcels subject to dry
    or pseudoadiabatic vertical evolutions and atmospheric instability indices that
    are routinely used for operational weather forecasts or meteorological diagnostics.
