  summary: PCA done by eigenvalue decomposition of a data correlation matrix, here it automatically
    determines the number of factors by eigenvalue greater than 1 and it gives the uncorrelated
    variables based on the rotated component scores, Such that in each principal component
    variable which has the high variance are selected. It will be useful for non-statisticians
    in selection of variables. For more information, see the <http://www.ijcem.org/papers032013/ijcem_032013_06.pdf>
