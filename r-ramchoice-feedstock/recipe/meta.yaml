  summary: 'It is widely documented in psychology, economics and other disciplines that socio-economic
    agent may not pay full attention to all available alternatives, rendering standard
    revealed preference theory invalid. This package implements the estimation and inference
    procedures of Cattaneo, Ma, Masatlioglu and Suleymanov (2019) <arXiv:1712.03448>,
    which utilizes standard choice data to partially identify and estimate a decision
    maker''s preference. For inference, several simulation-based critical values are
    provided. '
