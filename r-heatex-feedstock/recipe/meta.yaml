  summary: The heatex package calculates heat storage in the body and the components of heat
    exchange (conductive, convective, radiative, and evaporative) between the body and
    the environment during physical activity based on the principles of partitional
    calorimetry. The program enables heat exchange calculations for a range of environmental
    conditions when wearing various clothing ensembles.
