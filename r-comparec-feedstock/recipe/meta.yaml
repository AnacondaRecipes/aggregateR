  summary: Proposed by Harrell, the C index or concordance C, is considered an overall measure
    of discrimination in survival analysis between a survival outcome that is possibly
    right censored and a predictive-score variable, which can represent a measured biomarker
    or a composite-score output from an algorithm that combines multiple biomarkers.
    This package aims to statistically compare two C indices with right-censored survival
    outcome, which commonly arise from a paired design and thus resulting two correlated
    C indices.
