  summary: 'Includes: (i) tests and visualisations that can help the modeller explore time series
    components and perform decomposition; (ii) modelling shortcuts, such as functions
    to construct lagmatrices and seasonal dummy variables of various forms; (iii) an
    implementation of the Theta method; (iv) tools to facilitate the design of the forecasting
    process, such as ABC-XYZ analyses; and (v) "quality of life" functions, such as
    treating time series for trailing and leading values.'
