  summary: 'Aimed at applying the Harvest classification tree algorithm, modified algorithm of
    classic classification tree.The harvested tree has advantage of deleting redundant
    rules in trees, leading to a simplify and more efficient tree model.It was firstly
    used in drug discovery field, but it also performs well in other kinds of data,
    especially when the region of a class is disconnected. This package also improves
    the basic harvest classification tree algorithm by extending the field of data of
    algorithm to both continuous and categorical variables. To learn more about the
    harvest classification tree algorithm, you can go to http://www.stat.ubc.ca/Research/TechReports/techreports/220.pdf
    for more information. '
