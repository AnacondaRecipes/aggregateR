  summary: Functions to execute orders in backtesting using tick data. A testing platform was
    established by the four major execution functions, namely 'LimitBuy', 'LimitSell',
    'MarketBuy' and 'MarketSell', which enclosed all tedious aspects (such as queueing
    for order executions and calculate actual executed volumes) for order execution
    using tick data. Such that one can focus on the logic of strategies, rather than
    its execution.
