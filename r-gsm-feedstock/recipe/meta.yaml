  summary: Implementation of a Bayesian approach for estimating a mixture of gamma distributions
    in which the mixing occurs over the shape parameter. This family provides a flexible
    and novel approach for modeling heavy-tailed distributions, it is computationally
    efficient, and it only requires to specify a prior distribution for a single parameter.
