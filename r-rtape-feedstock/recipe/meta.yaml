  summary: Storing huge data in RData format causes problems because of the necessity to load
    the whole file to the memory in order to access and manipulate objects inside such
    file; rtape is a simple solution to this problem. The package contains several wrappers
    of R built-in serialize/unserialize mechanism allowing user to quickly append objects
    to a tape-like file and later iterate over them requiring only one copy of each
    stored object to reside in memory a time.
