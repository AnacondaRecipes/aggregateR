  summary: 'Perform the Adaptable Regularized Hotelling''s T^2 test (ARHT) proposed by Li et
    al., (2016) <arXiv:1609.08725>. Both one-sample and two-sample mean test are available
    with various probabilistic alternative prior models. It contains a function to consistently
    estimate higher order moments of the population covariance spectral distribution
    using the spectral of the sample covariance matrix (Bai et al. (2010) <doi:10.1111/j.1467-842X.2010.00590.x>).
    In addition, it contains a function to sample from 3-variate chi-squared random
    vectors approximately  with a given correlation matrix when the degrees of freedom
    are large. '
