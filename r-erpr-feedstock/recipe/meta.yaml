  summary: This package is dedicated to the analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs). Event-related
    potentials are the measured brain responses associated with a specific sensory,
    cognitive, or motor event and are obtained from electroencephalographic (EEG) signal.
    The erpR package contains a series of functions for importing ERP data, computing
    traditional ERP measures, exploratory ERP analyses and plotting.
