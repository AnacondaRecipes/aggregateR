  summary: Comparisons of floating point numbers are problematic due to errors associated with
    the binary representation of decimal numbers. Despite being aware of these problems,
    people still use numerical methods that fail to account for these and other rounding
    errors (this pitfall is the first to be highlighted in Circle 1 of Burns (2012)
    'The R Inferno' <http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf>). This package
    provides new relational operators useful for performing floating point number comparisons
    with a set tolerance.
