  summary: 'Several tests for high dimensional generalized linear models have been proposed recently.
    In this package, we implemented a new test called adaptive  sum of powered score
    (aSPU) for high dimensional generalized linear models, which is often more powerful
    than the existing methods in a wide scenarios. We also implemented permutation based
    version of several existing methods for research purpose. We recommend users use
    the aSPU test for their real testing problem. You can learn more about the tests
    implemented in the package via the following papers: 1. Pan, W., Kim, J., Zhang,
    Y., Shen, X. and Wei, P. (2014) <DOI:10.1534/genetics.114.165035> A powerful and
