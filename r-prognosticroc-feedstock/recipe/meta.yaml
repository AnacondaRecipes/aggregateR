  summary: 'Prognostic ROC curve is an alternative graphical approach to represent the discriminative
    capacity of the marker: a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve by plotting
    1 minus the survival in the high-risk group against 1 minus the survival in the
    low-risk group. This package contains functions to assess prognostic ROC curve.
    The user can enter the survival according to a model previously estimated or the
    user can also enter individual survival data for estimating the prognostic ROC curve
    by using Kaplan-Meier estimator. The area under the curve (AUC) corresponds to the
    probability that a patient in the low-risk group has a longer lifetime than a patient
    in the high-risk group. The prognostic ROC curve provides complementary information
    compared to survival curves. The AUC is assessed by using the trapezoidal rules.
    When survival curves do not reach 0, the prognostic ROC curve is incomplete and
    the extrapolations of the AUC are performed by assuming pessimist, optimist and
    non-informative situations.'
