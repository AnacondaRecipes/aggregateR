  summary: Contains common univariate and multivariate portmanteau test statistics for time series
    models. These tests are based on using asymptotic distributions such as chi-square
    distribution and based on using the Monte Carlo significance tests. Also, it can
    be used to simulate from univariate and multivariate seasonal time series models.
