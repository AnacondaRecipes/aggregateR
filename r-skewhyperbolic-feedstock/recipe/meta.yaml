  summary: Functions are provided for the density function, distribution function, quantiles
    and random number generation for the skew hyperbolic t-distribution. There are also
    functions that fit the distribution to data. There are functions for the mean, variance,
    skewness, kurtosis and mode of a given distribution and to calculate moments of
    any order about any centre. To assess goodness of fit, there are functions to generate
    a Q-Q plot, a P-P plot and a tail plot.
