  summary: 'Several fast random number generators are provided as C++ header only libraries:
    The PCG family by O''Neill (2014 <https://www.cs.hmc.edu/tr/hmc-cs-2014-0905.pdf>)
    as well as Xoroshiro128+ and Xoshiro256+ by Blackman and Vigna (2018 <arXiv:1805.01407>).
    In addition fast functions for generating random numbers according to a uniform,
    normal and exponential distribution are included. The latter two use the Ziggurat
    algorithm originally proposed by Marsaglia and Tsang (2000, <doi:10.18637/jss.v005.i08>).
    These functions are exported to R and as a C++ interface and are enabled for use
    with the default 64 bit generator from the PCG family, Xoroshiro128+ and Xoshiro256+
    as well as the 64 bit version of the 20 rounds Threefry engine (Salmon et al., 2011
    <doi:10.1145/2063384.2063405>) as provided by the package ''sitmo''.'
