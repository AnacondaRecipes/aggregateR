  summary: 'Provides the tools to produce catseye plots, principally by catseyesplot() function
    which calls R''s standard plot() function internally, or alternatively by the catseyes()
    function to overlay the catseye plot onto an existing R plot window. Catseye plots
    illustrate the normal distribution of the mean (picture a normal bell curve reflected
    over its base and rotated 90 degrees), with a shaded confidence interval; they are
    an intuitive way of illustrating and comparing normally distributed estimates, and
    are arguably a superior alternative to standard confidence intervals, since they
    show the full distribution rather than fixed quantile bounds. The catseyesplot and
    catseyes functions require pre-calculated means and standard errors (or standard
    deviations), provided as numeric vectors; this allows the flexibility of obtaining
    this information from a variety of sources, such as direct calculation or prediction
    from a model.  Catseye plots, as illustrations of the normal distribution of the
    means, are described in Cumming (2013 & 2014). Cumming, G. (2013). The new statistics:
