  summary: Reversible Jump MCMC (RJ-MCMC)sampling for approximating the posterior  distribution
    of a time varying regulatory network, under the Auto Regressive TIme VArying (ARTIVA)
    model (for a detailed description of the algorithm, see Lebre et al. BMC Systems
    Biology, 2010). Starting from time-course gene expression measurements for a gene
    of  interest (referred to as "target gene") and a set of genes (referred to as "parent
    genes") which may explain the expression of the target gene, the ARTIVA procedure
    identifies temporal segments for which a set of interactions occur between the "parent
    genes" and the "target gene". The time points that delimit the different temporal
    segments are referred to as changepoints (CP).
