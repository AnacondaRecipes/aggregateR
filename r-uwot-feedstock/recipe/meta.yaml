  summary: 'An implementation of the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection dimensionality
    reduction by McInnes et al. (2018) <arXiv:1802.03426>. It also provides means to
    transform new data and to carry out supervised dimensionality reduction. An implementation
    of the related LargeVis method of Tang et al. (2016) <arXiv:1602.00370> is also
    provided. This is a complete re-implementation in R (and C++, via the ''Rcpp'' package):
    no Python installation is required. See the uwot website (<https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot>)
    for more documentation and examples.'
