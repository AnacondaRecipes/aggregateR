  summary: To address the problem of insecurity of 'UDP'-based 'DNS' requests, 'Google Public
    DNS' offers 'DNS' resolution over an encrypted 'HTTPS' connection. 'DNS-over-HTTPS'
    greatly enhances privacy and security between a client and a recursive resolver,
    and complements 'DNSSEC' to provide end-to-end authenticated 'DNS' lookups. Functions
    that enable querying individual requests that bulk requests that return detailed
    responses and bulk requests are both provided. Support for reverse lookups is also
    provided. See <https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/dns-over-https>  for
    more information.
