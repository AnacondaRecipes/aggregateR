  summary: Contains functions for hidden Markov models with observations having extra zeros as
    defined in the following two publications, Wang, T., Zhuang, J., Obara, K. and Tsuruoka,
    H. (2016) <doi:10.1111/rssc.12194>; Wang, T., Zhuang, J., Buckby, J., Obara, K.
    and Tsuruoka, H. (2018) <doi:10.1029/2017JB015360>. The observed response variable
    is either univariate or bivariate Gaussian conditioning on presence of events, and
    extra zeros mean that the response variable takes on the value zero if nothing is
    happening. Hence the response is modelled as a mixture distribution of a Bernoulli
    variable and a continuous variable. That is, if the Bernoulli variable takes on
    the value 1, then the response variable is Gaussian, and if the Bernoulli variable
    takes on the value 0, then the response is zero too. This package includes functions
    for simulation, parameter estimation, goodness-of-fit, the Viterbi algorithm, and
    plotting the classified 2-D data. Some of the functions in the package are based
    on those of the R package 'HiddenMarkov' by David Harte.
