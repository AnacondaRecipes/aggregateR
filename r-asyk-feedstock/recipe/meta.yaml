  summary: A collection of functions related to density estimation by using Chen's (2000) idea.
    Mean Squared Errors (MSE) are calculated for estimated curves. For this purpose,
    R functions allow the distribution to be Gamma, Exponential or Weibull. For details
    see Chen (2000), Scaillet (2004) <doi:10.1080/10485250310001624819> and Khan and
    Akbar.
