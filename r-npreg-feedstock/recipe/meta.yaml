  summary: Multiple and generalized nonparametric regression using smoothing spline ANOVA models
    and generalized additive models. Includes support for Gaussian and non-Gaussian
    responses, smoothers for multiple types of predictors, interactions between smoothers
    of mixed types, and eight different methods for smoothing parameter selection.
