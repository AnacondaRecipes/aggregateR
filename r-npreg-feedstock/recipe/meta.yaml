  summary: Multiple and generalized nonparametric regression using smoothing spline ANOVA models
    and generalized additive models, as described in Helwig (2020) <doi:10.4135/9781526421036885885>.
    Includes support for Gaussian and non-Gaussian responses, smoothers for multiple
    types of predictors, interactions between smoothers of mixed types, eight different
    methods for smoothing parameter selection, and flexible tools for prediction and
    inference.
