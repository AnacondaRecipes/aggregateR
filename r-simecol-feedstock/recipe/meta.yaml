  summary: An object oriented framework to simulate ecological (and other) dynamic systems. It
    can be used for differential equations, individual-based (or agent-based) and other
    models as well. It supports structuring of simulation scenarios (to avoid copy and
    paste) and aims to improve readability and re-usability of code.
