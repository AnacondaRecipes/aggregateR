  summary: Simulates a population under the Fisher-Wright model (fixed or stochastic population
    size) with a one-step neutral mutation process (stepwise mutation model, logistic
    mutation model and exponential mutation model supported). The stochastic population
    sizes are random Poisson distributed and different kinds of population growth are
    supported. For the stepwise mutation model, it is possible to specify locus and
    direction specific mutation rate (in terms of upwards and downwards mutation rate).
    Intermediate generations can be saved in order to study e.g. drift.
