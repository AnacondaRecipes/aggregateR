  summary: 'An implementation of the mixed neighbourhood selection (MNS) algorithm. The MNS algorithm
    can be used to estimate multiple related precision matrices. In particular, the
    motivation behind this work was driven by the need to understand functional connectivity
    networks across multiple subjects. This package also contains an implementation
    of a novel algorithm through which to simulate multiple related precision matrices
    which exhibit properties frequently reported in neuroimaging analysis. '
