  summary: Alternative mechanism for importing objects from packages and R modules. The syntax
    allows for importing multiple objects with a single command in an expressive way.
    The import package bridges some of the gap between using library (or require) and
    direct (single-object) imports. Furthermore the imported objects are not placed
    in the current environment.
