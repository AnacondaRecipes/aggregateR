  summary: This is an alternative mechanism for importing objects from packages. The syntax allows
    for importing multiple objects from a package with a single command in an expressive
    way. The import package bridges some of the gap between using library (or require)
    and direct (single-object) imports. Furthermore the imported objects are not placed
    in the current environment. It is also possible to import objects from stand-alone
    .R files. For more information, refer to the package vignette.
