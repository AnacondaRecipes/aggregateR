  summary: Plot confidence interval from the objects of statistical tests such as t.test(), var.test(),
    cor.test(), prop.test() and fisher.test() ('htest' class), Tukey test [TukeyHSD()],
    Dunnett test [glht() in 'multcomp' package], logistic regression [glm()], and Tukey
    or Games-Howell test [posthocTGH() in 'userfriendlyscience' package]. Users are
    able to set the styles of lines and points. This package contains the function to
    calculate odds ratios and their confidence intervals from the result of logistic
    regression.
