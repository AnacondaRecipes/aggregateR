  summary: Additional nonlinear regression functions using self-start (SS) algorithms. One of
    the functions is the Beta growth function proposed by Yin et al. (2003) <doi:10.1093/aob/mcg029>.
    There are several other functions with breakpoints (e.g. linear-plateau, plateau-linear,
    exponential-plateau, plateau-exponential, quadratic-plateau, plateau-quadratic and
    bilinear), a non-rectangular hyperbola and a bell-shaped curve. Twenty eight (28)
    new self-start (SS) functions in total. This package also supports the publication
    'Nonlinear regression Models and applications in agricultural research' by Archontoulis
    and Miguez (2015) <doi:10.2134/agronj2012.0506>, a book chapter with similar material
    <doi:10.2134/appliedstatistics.2016.0003.c15> and a publication by Oddi et. al.
    (2019) in Ecology and Evolution <doi:10.1002/ece3.5543>. The function 'nlsLMList'
    uses 'nlsLM' for fitting, but it is otherwise almost identical to 'nlme::nlsList'.In
    addition, this release of the package provides functions for conducting simulations
    for 'nlme' and 'gnls' objects as well as bootstrapping. These functions are intended
    to work with the modeling framework of the 'nlme' package. It also provides four
    vignettes with extended examples.
