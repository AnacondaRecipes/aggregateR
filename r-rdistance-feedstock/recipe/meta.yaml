  summary: 'Distance-sampling is a popular method for estimating density and  abundance of organisms
    in ecology. Rdistance contains routines that   assist with analysis of distance-sampling
    data collected on point or line transects.  Distance models are specified using
    regression-like formula (similar  to lm, glm, etc.). Abundance routines perform
    automated bootstrapping and automated detection-function  selection. Overall (study
    area) and site-level (transect or point)  abundance estimates are available. A large
    suite of classical,  parametric detection functions are  included along with some
    uncommon parametric  functions (e.g., Gamma, negative exponential) and non-parametric
    smoothed distance functions. Custom (user-defined) detection functions are easily
    implemented (see vignette).  The help files and vignettes have been  vetted by multiple
    authors and tested in workshop  settings. '
