  summary: Allows access to selected services that are part of the 'Google Adwords' API <https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/start>.
    'Google Adwords' is an online advertising service by 'Google', that delivers Ads
    to users. This package offers a authentication process using 'OAUTH2'.  Currently,
    there are two methods of data of accessing the API, depending on the type of request.
    One method uses 'SOAP' requests which require building an 'XML' structure and then
    sent to the API. These are used for the 'ManagedCustomerService' and the 'TargetingIdeaService'.
    The second method is by building 'AWQL' queries for the reporting side of the 'Google
    Adwords' API.
