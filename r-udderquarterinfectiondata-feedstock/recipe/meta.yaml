  summary: The udder quarter infection data set contains infection times of individual cow udder
    quarters with Corynebacterium bovis (Laevens et al. 1997 <DOI:10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(97)76295-7>).
    Obviously, the four udder quarters are clustered within a cow, and udder quarters
    are sampled only approximately monthly, generating interval-censored data. The data
    set contains both covariates that change within a cow (e.g., front and rear udder
    quarters) and covariates that change between cows (e.g., parity [the number of previous
    calvings]). The correlation between udder infection times within a cow also is of
    interest, because this is a measure of the infectivity of the agent causing the
    disease. Various models have been applied to address the problem of interdependence
    for right-censored event times. These models, as applied to this data set, can be
    found back in the publications found in the reference list.
