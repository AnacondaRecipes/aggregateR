  summary: 'Interactive visualization of effects, response functions  and marginal effects for
    different kinds of regression models. In this version  linear regression models,
    generalized linear models, generalized additive models and linear mixed-effects
    models are supported.   Major features are the interactive approach and the handling
    of the effects of categorical covariates:  if two or more factors are used as covariates
    every combination of the levels of each  factor is treated separately. The automatic
    calculation of  marginal effects and a number of possibilities to customize the
    graphical output  are useful features as well.'
