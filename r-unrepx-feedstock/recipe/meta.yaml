  summary: Provides half-normal plots, reference plots, and Pareto plots of effects from an unreplicated
    experiment, along with various pseudo-standard-error measures, simulated reference
    distributions, and other tools. Many of these methods are described in Daniel C.
    (1959) <doi:10.1080/00401706.1959.10489866> and/or Lenth R.V. (1989) <doi:10.1080/00401706.1989.10488595>,
    but some new approaches are added and integrated in one package.
