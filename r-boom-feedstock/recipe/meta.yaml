  summary: A C++ library for Bayesian modeling, with an emphasis on Markov chain Monte Carlo.  Although
    boom contains a few R utilities (mainly plotting functions), its primary purpose
    is to install the BOOM C++ library on your system so that other packages can link
    against it.

# Package: Boom
# Version: 0.9.1
# Date: 2019-06-03
# Title: Bayesian Object Oriented Modeling
# Author: Steven L. Scott is the sole author and creator of the BOOM project. Some code in the BOOM libraries has been modified from other open source projects.  These include Cephes (obtained from Netlib, written by Stephen L. Moshier), NEWUOA (M.J.D Powell, obtained from Powell's web site), and a modified version of the R math libraries (R core development team).
