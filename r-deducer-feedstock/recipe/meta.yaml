  summary: An intuitive, cross-platform graphical data analysis system. It uses menus and dialogs
    to guide the user efficiently through the data manipulation and analysis process,
    and has an excel like spreadsheet for easy data frame visualization and editing.
    Deducer works best when used with the Java based R GUI JGR, but the dialogs can
    be called from the command line. Dialogs have also been integrated into the Windows
    Rgui.
