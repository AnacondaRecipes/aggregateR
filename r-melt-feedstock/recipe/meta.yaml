  summary: Performs multiple empirical likelihood tests for linear and generalized linear models.
    The package offers an easy-to-use interface and flexibility in specifying hypotheses
    and calibration methods, extending the framework to simultaneous inferences. The
    core computational routines are implemented using the 'Eigen' C++ library and 'RcppEigen'
    interface, with OpenMP for parallel computation. Details of the testing procedures
    are given in Kim, MacEachern, and Peruggia (2023) <doi:10.1080/10485252.2023.2206919>.
    This work was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under Grants No.
