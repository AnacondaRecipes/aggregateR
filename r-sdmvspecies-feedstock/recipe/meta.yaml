  summary: A software package help user to create virtual species for species distribution modelling.
    It includes several methods to help user to create virtual species distribution
    map. Those maps can be used for Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) study. SDM
    use environmental data for sites of occurrence of a species to predict all the sites
    where the environmental conditions are suitable for the species to persist, and
    may be expected to occur.
