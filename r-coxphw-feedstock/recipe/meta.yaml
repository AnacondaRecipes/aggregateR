  summary: Implements weighted estimation in Cox regression as proposed by Schemper, Wakounig
    and Heinze (Statistics in Medicine, 2009,  <doi:10.1002/sim.3623>) and as described
    in Dunkler, Ploner, Schemper and  Heinze (Journal of Statistical Software, 2018,
    <doi:10.18637/jss.v084.i02>).  Weighted Cox regression provides unbiased average
    hazard ratio  estimates also in case of non-proportional hazards.  Approximated
    generalized concordance probability an effect size measure for clear-cut decisions
    can be obtained. The package provides options to estimate time-dependent effects
    conveniently by including interactions of covariates with arbitrary functions of
    time, with or without making use of the weighting option.
