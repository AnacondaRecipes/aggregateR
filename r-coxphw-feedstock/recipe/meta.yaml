  summary: Implements weighted estimation in Cox regression as proposed by Schemper, Wakounig
    and Heinze (Statistics in Medicine, 2009, <doi:10.1002/sim.3623>) and as described
    in Dunkler, Ploner, Schemper and Heinze (Journal of Statistical Software, 2018,
    <doi:10.18637/jss.v084.i02>). Weighted Cox regression provides unbiased average
    hazard ratio estimates also in case of non-proportional hazards. Approximated generalized
    concordance probability an effect size measure for clear-cut decisions can be obtained.
    The package provides options to estimate time-dependent effects conveniently by
    including interactions of covariates with arbitrary functions of time, with or without
    making use of the weighting option.
