  summary: A fast integrative genetic association test for rare diseases based on a model for
    disease status given allele counts at rare variant sites. Probability of association,
    mode of inheritance and probability of pathogenicity for individual variants are
    all inferred in a Bayesian framework - 'A Fast Association Test for Identifying
    Pathogenic Variants Involved in Rare Diseases', Greene et al 2017 <doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2017.05.015>.
