  summary: "Contains a set of functions that can be used to apply formats to data frames or vectors.
    \ The package aims to provide to functionality similar to that of SAS\xAE formats.
    Formats are assigned to the format attribute on data frame columns.  Then when the
    fdata() function is called, a new data frame is created with the column data formatted
    as specified.  The package also contains a value() function to create a user-defined
    format, similar to a SAS\xAE user-defined format."
