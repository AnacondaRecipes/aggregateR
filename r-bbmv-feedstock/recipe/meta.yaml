  summary: 'Provides a set of functions to fit general macroevolutionary models for continuous
    traits evolving in adaptive landscapes of any shape. This package implements the
    Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov model (FPK), in which the trait evolves under random diffusion
    but is also subject to a force that pulls it towards specific values - this force
    can be of any shape. FPK has a version in which hard reflective bounds exist at
    the extremes of the trait interval: this second model is called BBMV. '
