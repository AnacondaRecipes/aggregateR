  summary: Analysis of repeated measurements and time-to-event data via random effects joint
    models. Fits the joint models proposed by Henderson and colleagues <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/1.4.465>
    (single event time) and by Williamson and colleagues (2008) <doi:10.1002/sim.3451>
    (competing risks events time) to a single continuous repeated measure. The time-to-event
    data is modelled using a (cause-specific) Cox proportional hazards regression model
    with time-varying covariates. The longitudinal outcome is modelled using a linear
    mixed effects model. The association is captured by a latent Gaussian process. The
    model is estimated using am Expectation Maximization algorithm. Some plotting functions
    and the variogram are also included. This project is funded by the Medical Research
    Council (Grant numbers G0400615 and MR/M013227/1).
