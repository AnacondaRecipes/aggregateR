  summary: MultiSV is an R package for identification of structural variations in multiple populations
    based on whole genome resequencing. It fits linear mixed model and identifies structural
    variations in multiple populations using whole genome sequencing data. It could
    also be manipulated to use on RNA-seq data for differential gene expression (implementation
    in future releases). Main steps for analysis include generating read depth in bins
    using ComputeBinCounts. conversion of bins to MultiSV format using Bin2MultiSV.
    Finally, identification of structural variations using CallMultiSV.
