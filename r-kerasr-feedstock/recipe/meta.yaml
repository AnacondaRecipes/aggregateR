  summary: Provides a consistent interface to the 'Keras' Deep Learning Library directly from
    within R. 'Keras' provides specifications for describing dense neural networks,
    convolution neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) running on
    top of either 'TensorFlow' or 'Theano'. Type conversions between Python and R are
    automatically handled correctly, even when the default choices would otherwise lead
    to errors. Includes complete R documentation and many working examples.
