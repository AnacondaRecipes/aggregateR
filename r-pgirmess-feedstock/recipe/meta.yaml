  summary: Set of tools for reading, writing and transforming spatial and seasonal data, model
    selection and specific statistical tests for ecologists. It includes functions to
    interpolate regular positions of points between landmarks, to discretize polylines
    into regular point positions, link distant observations to points and convert a
    bounding box in a spatial object. It also provides miscellaneous functions for field
    ecologists such as spatial statistics and inference on diversity indexes, writing
    data.frame with Chinese characters.
