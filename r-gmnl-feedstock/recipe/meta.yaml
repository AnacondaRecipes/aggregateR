  summary: An implementation of maximum simulated likelihood method for the estimation of multinomial
    logit models with random coefficients as presented by Sarrias and Daziano (2017)
    <doi:10.18637/jss.v079.i02>. Specifically, it allows estimating models with continuous
    heterogeneity such as the mixed multinomial logit and the generalized multinomial
    logit. It also allows estimating models with discrete heterogeneity such as the
    latent class and the mixed-mixed multinomial logit model.
