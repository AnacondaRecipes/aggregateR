  summary: This is a package for calculating power and sample size  in multiple testing situations
    using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) false discovery rate (FDR) procedure. The package
    computes power  and sample size in one of either two ways, using the average  power
    or the lambda-power. See Izmirlian, G. (2018) <arXiv:1801.03989>.
