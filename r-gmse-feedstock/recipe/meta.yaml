  summary: 'Integrates game theory and ecological theory to construct  social-ecological models
    that simulate the management of populations and  stakeholder actions. These models
    build off of a previously developed  management strategy evaluation (MSE) framework
    to simulate all aspects of  management: population dynamics, manager observation
    of populations, manager decision making, and stakeholder responses to management
    decisions. The  newly developed generalised management strategy evaluation (GMSE)  framework
    uses genetic algorithms to mimic the decision-making process of  managers and stakeholders
    under conditions of change, uncertainty, and  conflict. Simulations can be run using
    gmse(), gmse_apply(), and gmse_gui() functions.'
