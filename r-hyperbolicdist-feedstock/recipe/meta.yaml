  summary: This package provides functions for the hyperbolic and related distributions. Density,
    distribution and quantile functions and random number generation are provided for
    the hyperbolic distribution, the generalized hyperbolic distribution, the generalized
    inverse Gaussian distribution and the skew-Laplace distribution. Additional functionality
    is provided for the hyperbolic distribution, including fitting of the hyperbolic
    to data.
