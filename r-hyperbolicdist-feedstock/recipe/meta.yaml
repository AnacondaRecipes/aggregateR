  summary: Maintenance has been discontinued for this package. It has been superseded by 'GeneralizedHyperbolic'.
    'GeneralizedHyperbolic' includes all the functionality of 'HyperbolicDist' and more
    and is based on a more rational design. 'HyperbolicDist' provides functions for
    the hyperbolic and related distributions. Density, distribution and quantile functions
    and random number generation are provided for the hyperbolic distribution, the generalized
    hyperbolic distribution, the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution and the skew-Laplace
    distribution. Additional functionality is provided for the hyperbolic distribution,
    including fitting of the hyperbolic to data.
