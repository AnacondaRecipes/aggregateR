  summary: Given $p$-dimensional training data containing $d$ groups (the design space), a classification
    algorithm (classifier) predicts which group new data belongs to.  Generally the
    input to these algorithms is high dimensional, and the boundaries between groups
    will be high dimensional and perhaps curvilinear or multi-faceted. This package
    implements methods for understanding the division of space between the groups.
