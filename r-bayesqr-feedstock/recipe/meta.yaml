  summary: Bayesian quantile regression using the asymmetric Laplace distribution, both continuous
    as well as binary dependent variables are supported. The package consists of implementations
    of the methods of Yu & Moyeed (2001) <doi:10.1016/S0167-7152(01)00124-9>, Benoit
    & Van den Poel (2012) <doi:10.1002/jae.1216> and Al-Hamzawi, Yu & Benoit (2012)
    <doi:10.1177/1471082X1101200304>. To speed up the calculations, the Markov Chain
    Monte Carlo core of all algorithms is programmed in Fortran and called from R.
