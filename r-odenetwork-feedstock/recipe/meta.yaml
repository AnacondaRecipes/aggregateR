  summary: Simulates a network of ordinary differential equations of order two. The package provides
    an easy interface to construct networks. In addition you are able to define different
    external triggers to manipulate the trajectory. The method is described by Surmann,
    Ligges, and Weihs (2014) <doi:10.1109/ENERGYCON.2014.6850482>.
