  summary: An implementation of a boosted Tweedie compound Poisson model proposed by Yang, Y.,
    Qian, W. and Zou, H. (2018) <doi:10.1080/07350015.2016.1200981>. It is capable of
    fitting a flexible nonlinear Tweedie compound Poisson model (or a gamma model) and
    capturing high-order interactions among predictors. This package is based on the
    'gbm' package originally developed by Greg Ridgeway.
