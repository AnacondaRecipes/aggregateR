  summary: This package calculates the interval estimates for the parameters of  linear models
    heteroscedastic regression using bootstrap - (Wild Bootstrap) and double bootstrap-t
    (Wild Bootstrap). It is also possible to calculate confidence intervals using the
    percentile bootstrap and percentile bootstrap double. It is possible to calculate
    consistent estimates of the covariance matrix of the parameters of linear regression
    models with heteroskedasticity of unknown form. The package also provides function
    to calculate consistently the covariance matrix of the parameters of linear models
    with heteroskedasticity of unknown form.
