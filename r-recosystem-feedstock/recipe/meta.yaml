  summary: R wrapper of the 'libmf' library <http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libmf/> for recommender
    system using matrix factorization. It is typically used to approximate an incomplete
    matrix using the product of two matrices in a latent space. Other common names for
    this task include "collaborative filtering", "matrix completion", "matrix recovery",
    etc. High performance multi-core parallel computing is supported in this package.
