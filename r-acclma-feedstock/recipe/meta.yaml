  summary: The main function is plotLMA(sourcefile,header) that takes a data set and plots the
    appropriate LMA and ACC graphs. If no sourcefile (a string) was passed, a manual
    data entry window is opened. The header parameter indicates by TRUE/FALSE (false
    by default) if the source CSV file has a head row or not. The data set should contain
    only one independent variable (X) and one dependent varialbe (Y) and can contain
    a weight for each observation
