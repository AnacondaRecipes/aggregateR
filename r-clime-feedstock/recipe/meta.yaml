  summary: A robust constrained L1 minimization method for estimating a large sparse inverse
    covariance matrix (aka precision matrix), and recovering its support for building
    graphical models.  The computation uses linear programming.  The method was published
    in TT Cai, W Liu, X Luo (2011) <doi:10.1198/jasa.2011.tm10155>.
