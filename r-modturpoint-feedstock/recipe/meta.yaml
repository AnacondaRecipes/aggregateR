  summary: Turning point method is a method proposed by Choi (1990) <doi:10.2307/2531453> to
    estimate 50 percent effective dose (ED50) in the study of drug sensitivity. The
    method has its own advantages for that it can provide robust ED50 estimation. This
    package contains the modified function of Choi's turning point method.
