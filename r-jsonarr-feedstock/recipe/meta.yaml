  summary: This package enables users to access MongoDB by running queries and returning their
    results in R data frames. Usually, data in MongoDB is only available in the form
    of a JSON document. jSonarR uses data processing and conversion capabilities in
    the jSonar Analytics Platform and the JSON Studio Gateway (http://www.jsonstudio.com),
    to convert it to a tabular format which is easy to use with existing R packages.
