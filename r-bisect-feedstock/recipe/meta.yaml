  summary: An implementation of Bisect, a method for inferring cell type composition of samples
    based on methylation sequencing data (Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing and Reduced
    Representation Sequencing). The method is specifically tailored for sequencing data,
    and therefore works better than methods developed for methylation arrays. It contains
    a supervised mode that requires a reference (the methylation probabilities in the
    pure cell types), and a semi-supervised mode, that requires cell counts for a subset
    of the samples, but does not require a reference.
