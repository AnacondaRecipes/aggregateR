  summary: 'Routines for the analysis of indirectly measured haplotypes. The statistical methods
    assume that all subjects are unrelated and that haplotypes are ambiguous (due to
    unknown linkage phase of the genetic markers). The main functions are: haplo.em(),
    haplo.glm(), haplo.score(), and haplo.power(); all of which have detailed examples
    in the vignette.'
