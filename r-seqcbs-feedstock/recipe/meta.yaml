  summary: This is a method for DNA Copy Number Profiling using Next-Generation Sequencing. It
    has new model and test statistics based on non-homogeneous Poisson Processes with
    change point models. It uses an adaptation of Circular Binary Segmentation. Also
    included are methods for point-wise Bayesian Confidence Interval and model selection
    method for the change-point model. A case and a control sample reads (normal and
    tumor) are required.
