  summary: Processes gridded datasets found on the U.S. Geological Survey Geo Data Portal web
    application or elsewhere, using a web-enabled workflow that eliminates the need
    to download and store large datasets that are reliably hosted on the Internet. The
    package provides access to several data subset and summarization algorithms that
    are available on remote web processing servers (Read et al. (2015) <doi:10.1111/ecog.01880>).
