  summary: Application of the filtered monotonic polynomial (FMP) item response model to flexibly
    fit item response models. The package includes tools that allow the item response
    model to be build on any monotonic transformation of the latent trait metric, as
    described by Feuerstahler (2019) <doi:10.1007/s11336-018-9642-9>.
