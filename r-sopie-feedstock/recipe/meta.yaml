  summary: Provides functions to non-parametrically estimate the off-pulse interval of a source
    function originating from a pulsar. The technique is based on a sequential application
    of P-values obtained from goodness-of-fit tests for the uniform distribution, such
    as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramer-von Mises, Anderson-Darling and Rayleigh goodness-of-fit
    tests.
