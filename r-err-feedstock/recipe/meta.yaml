  summary: Messages should provide users with readable information about R objects without flooding
    their console. 'cc()' concatenates vector and data frame values into a grammatically
    correct string using commas, an ellipsis and conjunction. 'cn()' allows the user
    to define a string which varies based on a count. 'co()' combines the two to produce
    a customizable object aware string. The package further facilitates this process
    by providing five 'sprintf'-like types such as '%n' for the length of an object
    and '%o' for its name as well as wrappers for pasting objects and issuing errors,
    warnings and messages.
