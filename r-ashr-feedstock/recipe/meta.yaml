  summary: 'The R package ''ashr'' implements an Empirical Bayes approach for large-scale hypothesis
    testing and false discovery rate (FDR) estimation based on the methods proposed
    in M. Stephens, 2016, "False discovery rates: a new deal", <DOI:10.1093/biostatistics/kxw041>.
    These methods can be applied whenever two sets of summary statistics---estimated
    effects and standard errors---are available, just as ''qvalue'' can be applied to
    previously computed p-values. Two main interfaces are provided: ash(), which is
    more user-friendly; and ash.workhorse(), which has more options and is geared toward
    advanced users. The ash() and ash.workhorse() also provides a flexible modeling
    interface that can accommodate a variety of likelihoods (e.g., normal, Poisson)
    and mixture priors (e.g., uniform, normal).'
