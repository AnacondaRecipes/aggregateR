  summary: Estimation, inference and diagnostics for Univariate Autoregressive Markov Switching
    Models for Linear and Generalized Models. Distributions for the series include gaussian,
    Poisson, binomial and gamma cases. The EM algorithm is used for estimation (see
    Perlin (2012) <doi:10.2139/ssrn.1714016>).
