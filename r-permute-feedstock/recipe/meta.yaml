  summary: A set of restricted permutation designs for freely exchangeable, line transects (time
    series), and spatial grid designs plus permutation of blocks (groups of samples)
    is provided. 'permute' also allows split-plot designs, in which the whole-plots
    or split-plots or both can be freely-exchangeable or one of the restricted designs.
    The 'permute' package is modelled after the permutation schemes of 'Canoco 3.1'
    (and later) by Cajo ter Braak.
