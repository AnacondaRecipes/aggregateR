  summary: 'Utilities to read and write files in the FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) format,
    a standard format in astronomy (see e.g. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FITS> for
    more information). Present low-level routines allow: reading, parsing, and modifying
    FITS headers; reading FITS images (multi-dimensional arrays); reading FITS binary
    and ASCII tables; and writing FITS images (multi-dimensional arrays).  Higher-level
    functions allow: reading files composed of one or more headers and a single (perhaps
    multidimensional) image or single table; reading tables into data frames; generating
    vectors for image array axes; scaling and writing images as 16-bit integers.  Known
    incompletenesses are reading random group extensions, as well as complex and array
    descriptor data types in binary tables.'
