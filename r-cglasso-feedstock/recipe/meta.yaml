  summary: 'Conditional graphical lasso estimator is an extension of the graphical lasso proposed
    to estimate the conditional dependence structure of a set of p response variables
    given q predictors. This package provides suitable extensions developed to study
    datasets with censored and/or missing values. Standard conditional graphical lasso
    is available as a special case. Furthermore, the package provides an integrated
    set of core routines for visualization, analysis, and simulation of datasets with
    censored and/or missing values drawn from a Gaussian graphical model. Details about
    the implemented models can be found in Augugliaro et al. (2020b) <doi: 10.1007/s11222-020-09945-7>,
