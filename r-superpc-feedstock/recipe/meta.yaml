  summary: Does prediction in the case of a censored survival outcome, or a regression outcome,
    using the "supervised principal component" approach. 'Superpc' is especially useful
    for high-dimensional data when the number of features p dominates the number of
    samples n (p >> n paradigm), as generated, for instance, by high-throughput technologies.
