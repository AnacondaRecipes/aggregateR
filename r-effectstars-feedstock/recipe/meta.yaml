  summary: 'Notice: The package EffectStars2 provides a more up-to-date implementation of effect
    stars! EffectStars provides functions to visualize regression models with categorical
    response as proposed by Tutz and Schauberger (2013) <doi:10.1080/10618600.2012.701379>.
    The effects of the variables are plotted with star plots in order to allow for an
    optical impression of the fitted model.'
