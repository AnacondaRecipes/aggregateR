  summary: The function generates and plots random snowflakes. Each snowflake is defined by a
    given diameter, width of the crystal, color, and random seed. Snowflakes are plotted
    in such way that they always remain round, no matter what the aspect ratio of the
    plot is. Snowflakes can be created using transparent colors, which creates a more
    interesting, somewhat realistic, image. Images of the snowflakes can be separately
    saved as svg files and used in websites as static or animated images.
