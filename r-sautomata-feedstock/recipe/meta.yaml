  summary: Machine learning provides algorithms that can learn from data and make inferences
    or predictions. Stochastic automata is a class of input/output devices which can
    model components. This work provides implementation an inference algorithm for stochastic
    automata which is similar to the Viterbi algorithm. Moreover, we specify a learning
    algorithm using the expectation-maximization technique and provide a more efficient
    implementation of the Baum-Welch algorithm for stochastic automata. This work is
    based on Inference and learning in stochastic automata was by Karl-Heinz Zimmermann(2017)
