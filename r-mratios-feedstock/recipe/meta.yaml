  summary: Performs (simultaneous) inferences for ratios of linear combinations of coefficients
    in the general linear model, linear mixed model, and for quantiles in a one-way
    layout. Multiple comparisons and simultaneous confidence interval estimations can
    be performed for ratios of treatment means in the normal one-way layout with homogeneous
    and heterogeneous treatment variances, according to Dilba et al. (2007) <https://cran.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2007-1.pdf>
    and Hasler and Hothorn (2008) <doi:10.1002/bimj.200710466>. Confidence interval
    estimations for ratios of linear combinations of linear model parameters like in
    (multiple) slope ratio and parallel line assays can be carried out. Moreover, it
    is possible to calculate the sample sizes required in comparisons with a control
    based on relative margins. For the simple two-sample problem, functions for a t-test
    for ratio-formatted hypotheses and the corresponding confidence interval are provided
    assuming homogeneous or heterogeneous group variances.
