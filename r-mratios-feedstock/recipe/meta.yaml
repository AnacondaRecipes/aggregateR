  summary: Performs (simultaneous) inferences for ratios of linear combinations of coefficients
    in the general linear model. Multiple comparisons and simultaneous confidence interval
    estimations can be performed for ratios of treatment means in the normal one-way
    layout with homogeneous and heterogeneous treatment variances, according to Dilba
    et al. (2007) <https://cran.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2007-1.pdf> and Hasler
    and Hothorn (2008) <doi:10.1002/bimj.200710466>. Confidence interval estimations
    for ratios of linear combinations of linear model parameters like in (multiple)
    slope ratio and parallel line assays can be carried out. Moreover, it is possible
    to calculate the sample sizes required in comparisons with a control based on relative
    margins. For the simple two-sample problem, functions for a t-test for ratio-formatted
    hypotheses and the corresponding confidence interval are provided assuming homogeneous
    or heterogeneous group variances.
