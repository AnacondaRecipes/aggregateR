  summary: Two discretization-based Monte Carlo algorithms, namely the Fu-Wang algorithm and
    the Wang-Lee algorithm, are provided for random sample generation from a high dimensional
    distribution of complex structure.  The normalizing constant of the target distribution
    needs not to be known.
