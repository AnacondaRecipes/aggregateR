  summary: Implements the algorithm described in Barron, M., Zhang, S. and Li, J. 2017, "A sparse
    differential clustering algorithm for tracing cell type changes via single-cell
    RNA-sequencing data", Nucleic Acids Research, gkx1113, <doi:10.1093/nar/gkx1113>.
    This algorithm clusters samples from two different populations, links the clusters
    across the conditions and identifies marker genes for these changes. The package
    was designed for scRNA-Seq data but is also applicable to many other data types,
    just replace cells with samples and genes with variables. The package also contains
    functions for estimating the parameters for SparseDC as outlined in the paper. We
    recommend that users further select their marker genes using the magnitude of the
    cluster centers.
