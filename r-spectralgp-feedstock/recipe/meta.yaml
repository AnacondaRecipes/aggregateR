  summary: 'Routines for creating, manipulating, and performing Bayesian inference about Gaussian
    processes in one and two dimensions using the Fourier basis approximation: simulation
    and plotting of processes, calculation of coefficient variances, calculation of
    process density, coefficient proposals (for use in MCMC).  It uses R environments
    to store GP objects as references/pointers.'
