  summary: Local structure in genomic data often induces dependence between observations taken
    at different genomic locations.  Ignoring this dependence leads to underestimation
    of the standard error of parameter estimates.  This package uses block bootstrapping
    to estimate asymptotically correct standard errors of parameters from any standard
    generalised linear model that may be fit by the glm() function.
