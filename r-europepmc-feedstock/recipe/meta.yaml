  summary: An R Client for the Europe PubMed Central RESTful Web Service (see <https://europepmc.org/RestfulWebService>
    for more information). It gives access to both metadata on life science literature
    and open access full texts. Europe PMC indexes all PubMed content and other literature
    sources including Agricola, a bibliographic database of citations to the agricultural
    literature, or Biological Patents. In addition to bibliographic metadata, the client
    allows users to fetch citations and reference lists. Links between life-science
    literature and other EBI databases, including ENA, PDB or ChEMBL are also accessible.
    No registration or API key is required. See the vignettes for usage examples.
