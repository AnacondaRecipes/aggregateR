  summary: In biomedical studies, researchers are often interested in assessing the association
    between one or more ordinal explanatory variables and an outcome variable, at the
    same time adjusting for covariates of any type. The outcome variable may be continuous,
    binary, or represent censored survival times. In the absence of a precise knowledge
    of the response function, using monotonicity constraints on the ordinal variables
    improves efficiency in estimating parameters, especially when sample sizes are small.
    This package implements an active set algorithm that efficiently computes such estimators.
