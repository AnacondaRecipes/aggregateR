  summary: Implements a Gibbs sampler to do linear regression with multiple covariates, multiple
    responses, Gaussian measurement errors on covariates and responses, Gaussian intrinsic
    scatter, and a covariate prior distribution which is given by either a Gaussian
    mixture of specified size or a Dirichlet process with a Gaussian base distribution.
    Described further in Mantz (2016) <DOI:10.1093/mnras/stv3008>.
