  summary: Calculates the Delaunay triangulation and the Dirichlet or Voronoi tessellation (with
    respect to the entire plane) of a planar point set. Plots triangulations and tessellations
    in various ways.  Clips tessellations to sub-windows. Calculates perimeters of tessellations.  Summarises
    information about the tiles of the tessellation.
