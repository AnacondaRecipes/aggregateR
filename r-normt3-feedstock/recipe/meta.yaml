  summary: Evaluates the probability density function of the sum of the Gaussian and Student's
    t density on 3 degrees of freedom. Evaluates the p.d.f. of the sphered Student's
    t density function.  Also evaluates the erf, and erfc functions on complex-valued
    arguments. Thanks to Krishna Myneni the function is calculates the Faddeeva function
    also!
