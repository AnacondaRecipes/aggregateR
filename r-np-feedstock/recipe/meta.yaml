  summary: Nonparametric (and semiparametric) kernel methods that seamlessly handle a mix of
    continuous, unordered, and ordered factor data types. We would like to gratefully

    Canada (NSERC, <https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/>), the Social Sciences and Humanities

    Hierarchical Academic Research Computing Network (SHARCNET, <https://sharcnet.ca/>).
    We would also like to acknowledge the contributions of the GNU GSL authors. In particular,
    we adapt the GNU GSL B-spline routine gsl_bspline.c adding automated support for
    quantile knots (in addition to uniform knots), providing missing functionality for
    derivatives, and for extending the splines beyond their endpoints.
