  summary: Asymptotic simultaneous confidence intervals for comparison of many treatments with
    one control, for the difference of binomial proportions, allows for Dunnett-like-adjustment,
    Bonferroni or unadjusted intervals. Simulation of power of the above interval methods,
    approximate calculation of any-pair-power, and sample size iteration based on approximate
    any-pair power. Exact conditional maximum test for many-to-one comparisons to a
    control.
