  summary: Offers useful functions to perform day-to-day data manipulation  operations, data
    quality checks and post modelling statistical checks. One can effortlessly change
    class of a number of variables to factor,  remove duplicate observations from the
    data, create deciles of a  variable, perform data quality checks for continuous
    (integer or numeric),  categorical (factor) and date variables, and compute goodness
    of fit  measures such as auc for statistical models. The functions are consistent  for
    objects of class 'data.frame' and 'data.table', which is an enhanced  'data.frame'
    implemented in the package 'data.table'.
