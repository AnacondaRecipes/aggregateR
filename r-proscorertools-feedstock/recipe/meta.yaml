  summary: 'Provides a reliable and flexible toolbox to score  patient-reported outcome (PRO),
    Quality of Life (QOL), and other  psychometric measures. The guiding philosophy
    is that scoring errors can  be eliminated by using a limited number of well-tested,
    well-behaved  functions to score PRO-like measures. The workhorse of the package
    is  the ''scoreScale'' function, which can be used to score most single-scale  measures.
    It can reverse code items that need to be reversed before  scoring and pro-rate
    scores for missing item data. Currently, three  different types of scores can be
    output: summed item scores, mean item  scores, and scores scaled to range from 0
    to 100. The ''PROscorerTools''  functions can be used to write new functions that
    score more complex  measures. In fact, ''PROscorerTools'' functions are the building
    blocks of  the scoring functions in the ''PROscorer'' package (which is a repository  of
    functions that score specific commonly-used instruments). Users are  encouraged
    to use ''PROscorerTools'' to write scoring functions for their  favorite PRO-like
    instruments, and to submit these functions for  inclusion in ''PROscorer'' (a tutorial
    vignette will be added soon). The  long-term vision for the ''PROscorerTools'' and
    ''PROscorer'' packages is to  provide an easy-to-use system to facilitate the incorporation
    of PRO  measures into research studies in a scientifically rigorous and  reproducible
    manner. These packages and their vignettes are intended to  help establish and promote
    "best practices" for scoring and describing  PRO-like measures in research. '
