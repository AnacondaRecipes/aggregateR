  summary: 'Provides a reliable and flexible toolbox to score patient-reported outcome (PRO),
    Quality of Life (QOL), and other psychometric measures. The guiding philosophy is
    that scoring errors can be eliminated by using a limited number of well-tested,
    well-behaved functions to score PRO-like measures. The workhorse of the package
    is the ''scoreScale'' function, which can be used to score most single-scale measures.
    It can reverse code items that need to be reversed before scoring and pro-rate scores
    for missing item data. Currently, three different types of scores can be output:
    summed item scores, mean item scores, and scores scaled to range from 0 to 100.
    The ''PROscorerTools'' functions can be used to write new functions that score more
    complex measures. In fact, ''PROscorerTools'' functions are the building blocks
    of the scoring functions in the ''PROscorer'' package (which is a repository of
    functions that score specific commonly-used instruments). Users are encouraged to
    use ''PROscorerTools'' to write scoring functions for their favorite PRO-like instruments,
    and to submit these functions for inclusion in ''PROscorer'' (a tutorial vignette
    will be added soon). The long-term vision for the ''PROscorerTools'' and ''PROscorer''
    packages is to provide an easy-to-use system to facilitate the incorporation of
    PRO measures into research studies in a scientifically rigorous and reproducible
    manner. These packages and their vignettes are intended to help establish and promote
    "best practices" for scoring and describing PRO-like measures in research.'
