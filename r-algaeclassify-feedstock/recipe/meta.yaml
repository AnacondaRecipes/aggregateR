  summary: Functions designed to facilitate the assignment of morpho-functional group (MFG) classifications
    to phytoplankton species based on a combination of taxonomy (Class,Order) and a
    suite of 7 binomial functional traits. Classifications can also be made using only
    a species list and a database of trait-derived classifications included in the package.
    MFG classifications are derived from Salmaso et al. (2015) <doi:10.1111/fwb.12520>
    and this reference should be cited when using the package. The 'algaeClassify' package
    is a product of the GEISHA (Global Evaluation of the Impacts of Storms on freshwater
    Habitat and Structure of phytoplankton Assemblages), funded by CESAB (Centre for
    Synthesis and Analysis of Biodiversity) and the USGS John Wesley Powell Center,
    with data and other support provided by members of GLEON (Global Lake Ecology Observation
