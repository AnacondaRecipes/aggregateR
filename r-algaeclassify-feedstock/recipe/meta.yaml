  summary: Functions that facilitate the use of accepted taxonomic nomenclature, collection of
    functional trait data, and assignment of functional group classifications to phytoplankton
    species. Possible classifications include Morpho-functional group (MFG; Salmaso
    et al. 2015 <doi:10.1111/fwb.12520>) and CSR (Reynolds 1988; Functional morphology
    and the adaptive strategies of phytoplankton. In C.D. Sandgren (ed). Growth and
    reproductive strategies of freshwater phytoplankton, 388-433. Cambridge University
    Press, New York). Versions 1.3.0 and later no longer include the algae_search()
    function for querying the algaebase online taxonomic database (www.algaebase.org).
    Users are advised to verify taxonomic names directly using algaebase and cite the
    database in resulting publications. Note that none of the algaeClassify authors
    are affiliated with algaebase in any way. The algaeClassify package is a product
    of the GEISHA (Global Evaluation of the Impacts of Storms on freshwater Habitat
    and Structure of phytoplankton Assemblages), funded by CESAB (Centre for Synthesis
    and Analysis of Biodiversity) and the USGS John Wesley Powell Center for Synthesis
    and Analysis, with data and other support provided by members of GLEON (Global Lake
    Ecology Observation Network). This software is preliminary or provisional and is
    subject to revision. It is being provided to meet the need for timely best science.
    The software has not received final approval by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
    No warranty, expressed or implied, is made by the USGS or the U.S. Government as
    to the functionality of the software and related material nor shall the fact of
