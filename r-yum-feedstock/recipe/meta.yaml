  summary: Provides a number of functions to facilitate extracting information in 'YAML' fragments
    from one or  multiple files, optionally structuring the information in a 'data.tree'.
    'YAML' (recursive acronym for "YAML ain't Markup Language") is a convention for
    specifying structured data in a format that is both machine- and human-readable.
    'YAML' therefore lends itself well for embedding (meta)data in plain text files,
    such as Markdown files. This principle is implemented in 'yum' with minimal dependencies
    (i.e. only the 'yaml' packages, and the 'data.tree' package can be used to enable
    additional functionality).
