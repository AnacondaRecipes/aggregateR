  summary: A set of functions have been implemented to generate random data to perform Monte
    Carlo simulations on structural models with formative constructs and interaction
    and nonlinear effects (Two-Step PLS Mode B structural models). The setup of the
    true model considers a simple structure with three formative exogenous constructs
    related to one formative endogenous construct. The routines take into account the
    interaction and nonlinear effects of the exogenous constructs on the endogenous
    construct.
