  summary: To compute the non-parametric maximum likelihood estimates (NPMLEs) and penalized
    NPMLEs with SCAD, HARD and LASSO penalties for nested case-control or case-cohort
    sampling design with time matching under Cox's regression model. It also proposes
    the standard error formula for estimator using observed profile likelihood. For
    details about (penalized) NPNLEs see the original paper "Penalized Full Likelihood
    Approach to Variable Selection for Cox's Regression Model under Nested Case-Control
    Sampling" by Wang et al. (2019) <doi:10.1007/s10985-019-09475-z>.
