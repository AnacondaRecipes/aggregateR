  summary: Calculates equations commonly used in clinical pharmacokinetics and clinical pharmacology,
    such as equations for dose individualization, compartmental pharmacokinetics, drug
    exposure, anthropomorphic calculations, clinical chemistry, and conversion of common
    clinical parameters. Where possible and relevant, it provides multiple published
    and peer-reviewed equations within the respective R function.
