  summary: Fits unimodal and multimodal gambin distributions to species-abundance distributions
    from ecological data, as in in Matthews et al. (2014) <DOI:10.1111/ecog.00861>.
    'gambin' is short for 'gamma-binomial'. The main function is fit_abundances(), which
    estimates the 'alpha' parameter(s) of the gambin distribution using maximum likelihood.
    Functions are also provided to generate the gambin distribution and for calculating
    likelihood statistics.
