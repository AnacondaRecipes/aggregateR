  summary: The multispecies and individual-based model (IBM) 'OSMOSE' (Shin and Curry (2001)
    <doi:10.1016/S0990-7440(01)01106-8> and Shin and Curry (2004) <doi:10.1139/f03-154>)
    focuses on fish species. This model assumes opportunistic predation based on spatial
    co-occurrence and size adequacy between a predator and its prey (size-based opportunistic
    predation). It represents fish individuals grouped into schools, which are characterized
    by their size, weight, age, taxonomy and geographical location (2D model), and which
    undergo major processes of fish life cycle (growth, explicit predation, natural
    and starvation mortalities, reproduction and migration) and fishing exploitation.
    The model needs basic biological parameters that are often available for a wide
    range of species, and which can be found in 'FishBase' for instance (see <http://www.fishbase.org/search.php>),
    and fish spatial distribution data. This package provides tools to build and run
    simulations using the 'OSMOSE' model.
