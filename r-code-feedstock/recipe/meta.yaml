  summary: Generates all necessary C functions allowing the user to work with the compiled-code
    interface of ode() and bvptwp(). The implementation supports "forcings" and "events".
    Also provides functions to symbolically compute Jacobians, sensitivity equations
    and adjoint sensitivities being the basis for sensitivity analysis.
