  summary: Deep Gaussian mixture models as proposed by Viroli and McLachlan (2019)  <doi:10.1007/s11222-017-9793-z>
    provide a generalization of classical Gaussian mixtures  to multiple layers. Each
    layer contains a set of latent variables that follow  a mixture of Gaussian distributions.
    To avoid overparameterized solutions, dimension  reduction is applied at each layer
    by way of factor models.
