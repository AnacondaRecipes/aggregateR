  summary: 'Main functionality is to provide the algorithmic complexity for short strings, an
    approximation of the Kolmogorov Complexity of a short string using the coding theorem
    method (see ?acss). The database containing the complexity is provided in the data
    only package acss.data, this package provides functions accessing the data such
    as prob_random returning the posterior probability that a given string was produced
    by a random process. In addition, two traditional (but problematic) measures of
    complexity are also provided: entropy and change complexity.'
