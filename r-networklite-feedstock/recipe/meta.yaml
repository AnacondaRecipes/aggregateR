  summary: An implementation of some of the core 'network' package functionality based on a simplified
    data structure that is faster in many research applications. This package is designed
    for back-end use in the 'statnet' family of packages, including 'EpiModel'. Support
    is provided for binary and weighted, directed and undirected, bipartite and unipartite
    networks; no current support for multigraphs, hypergraphs, or loops.
