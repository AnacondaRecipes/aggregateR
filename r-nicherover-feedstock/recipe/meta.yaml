  summary: Implementation of a probabilistic method to calculate 'nicheROVER' (_niche_ _r_egion
    and niche _over_lap) metrics using multidimensional niche indicator data (e.g.,
    stable isotopes, environmental variables, etc.). The niche region is defined as
    the joint probability density function of the multidimensional niche indicators
    at a user-defined probability alpha (e.g., 95%).  Uncertainty is accounted for in
    a Bayesian framework, and the method can be extended to three or more indicator
    dimensions.  It provides directional estimates of niche overlap, accounts for species-specific
    distributions in multivariate niche space, and produces unique and consistent bivariate
    projections of the multivariate niche region.  The article by Swanson et al. (Ecology,
    2015) provides a detailed description of the methodology.  See the package vignette
    for a worked example using fish stable isotope data.
