  summary: 'Calculates classic and/or bootstrap confidence intervals for many parameters such
    as the population mean, variance, interquartile range (IQR), median absolute deviation
    (MAD), skewness, kurtosis, Cramer''s V, odds ratio, R-squared, quantiles (incl.
    median), proportions, different types of correlation measures, difference in means,
    quantiles and medians. Many of the classic confidence intervals are described in
    Smithson, M. (2003, ISBN: 978-0761924999). Bootstrap confidence intervals are calculated
    with the R package ''boot''. Both one- and two-sided intervals are supported.'
