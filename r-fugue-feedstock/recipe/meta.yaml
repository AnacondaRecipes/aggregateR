  summary: As in music, a fugue statistic repeats a theme in small variations.  Here, the psi-function
    that defines an m-statistic is slightly altered to maintain the same design sensitivity
    in matched sets of different sizes.  The main functions in the package are sen()
    and senCI().  For sensitivity analyses for m-statistics, see Rosenbaum (2007) Biometrics
    63 456-464 <doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2006.00717.x>.
