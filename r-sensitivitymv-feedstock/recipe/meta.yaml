  summary: The package performs a sensitivity analysis in an observational study using an M-statistic,
    for instance, the mean.  The main function in the package is senmv(), but amplify()
    and truncatedP() are also useful.  The method is developed in Rosenbaum Biometrics,
    2007, 63, 456-464, <doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2006.00717.x>.
