  summary: Provides a function kitten() which creates cute little packages which pass R package
    checks. This sets it apart from package.skeleton() which it calls, and which leaves
    imperfect files behind. As this is not exactly helpful for beginners, kitten() offers
    an alternative. Unit test support can be added via the 'tinytest' package (if present),
    and documentation-creation support can be added via 'roxygen2' (if present).
