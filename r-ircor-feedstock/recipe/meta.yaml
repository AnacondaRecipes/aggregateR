  summary: Provides implementation of various correlation coefficients of common use in Information
    Retrieval. In particular, it includes Kendall (1970, isbn:0852641990) tau coefficient
    as well as tau_a and tau_b for the treatment of ties. It also includes Yilmaz et
    al. (2008) <doi:10.1145/1390334.1390435> tauAP correlation coefficient, and versions
    tauAP_a and tauAP_b developed by Urbano and Marrero (2017) <doi:10.1145/3121050.3121106>
    to cope with ties.
