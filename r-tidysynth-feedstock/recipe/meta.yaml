  summary: A synthetic control offers a way of evaluating the effect of an intervention in comparative
    case studies. The package makes a number of improvements when implementing the method
    in R. These improvements allow users to inspect, visualize, and tune the synthetic
    control more easily. A key benefit of a tidy implementation is that the entire preparation
    process for building the synthetic control can be accomplished in a single pipe.
