  summary: Deconvolving thermoluminescence glow curves according to various  kinetic models (first-order,
    second-order, general-order, and mixed-order) using  a modified Levenberg-Marquardt
    algorithm. It provides the possibility of setting  constraints or fixing any of
    parameters. It offers an interactive way to initialize  parameters by clicking with
    a mouse on a plot at positions where peak maxima should  be located. The optimal
    estimate is obtained by "trial-and-error". It also provides  routines for simulating
    first-order, second-order, and general-order glow peaks.
