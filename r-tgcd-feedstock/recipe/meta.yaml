  summary: Deconvolving thermoluminescence glow curves according to various kinetic models (first-order,
    second-order, general-order, and mixed-order) using a modified Levenberg-Marquardt
    algorithm (More, 1978) <DOI:10.1007/BFb0067700>. It provides the possibility of
    setting constraints or fixing any of parameters. It offers an interactive way to
    initialize parameters by clicking with a mouse on a plot at positions where peak
    maxima should be located. The optimal estimate is obtained by "trial-and-error".
    It also provides routines for simulating first-order, second-order, and general-order
    glow peaks.
