  summary: An array of nonparametric and parametric estimation methods for cognitive diagnostic
    models, including nonparametric classification of examinee attribute profiles, joint
    maximum likelihood estimation (JMLE) of examinee attribute profiles and item parameters,
    and nonparametric refinement of the Q-matrix, as well as conditional maximum likelihood
    estimation (CMLE) of examinee attribute profiles given item parameters and CMLE
    of item parameters given examinee attribute profiles. Currently the nonparametric
    methods in the package support both conjunctive and disjunctive models, and the
    parametric methods in the package support the DINA model, the DINO model, the NIDA
    model, the G-NIDA model, and the R-RUM model.
