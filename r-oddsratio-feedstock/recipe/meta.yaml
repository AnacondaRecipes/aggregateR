  summary: Simplified odds ratio calculation of GAM(M)s & GLM(M)s. Provides structured output
    (data frame) of all predictors and their corresponding odds ratios and confident
    intervals for further analyses.  It helps to avoid false references of predictors
    and increments by specifying these parameters in a list instead of using 'exp(coef(model))'
    (standard approach of odds ratio calculation for GLMs) which just returns a plain
    numeric output.  For GAM(M)s, odds ratio calculation is highly simplified with this
    package since it takes care of the multiple 'predict()' calls of the chosen predictor
    while holding other predictors constant. Also, this package allows odds ratio calculation
    of percentage steps across the whole predictor distribution range for GAM(M)s.  In
    both cases, confident intervals are returned additionally. Calculated odds ratio
    of GAM(M)s can be inserted into the smooth function plot.
