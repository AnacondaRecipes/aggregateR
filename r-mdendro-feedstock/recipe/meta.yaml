  summary: A collection of methods for agglomerative hierarchical clustering strategies on a
    matrix of distances, implemented using the variable-group approach introduced in
    Fernandez and Gomez (2008) <doi:10.1007/s00357-008-9004-x>. Descriptive measures
    to analyze the resulting hierarchical trees are also provided. In addition to the
    usual clustering methods, two parameterized methods are provided to explore an infinite
    family of hierarchical clustering strategies. When there are ties in proximity values,
    the hierarchical trees obtained are unique and independent of the order of the elements
    in the input matrix.
