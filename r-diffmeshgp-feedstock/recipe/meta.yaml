  summary: This R function implements the nonstationary Kriging model proposed by Tuo, Wu and
    Yu (2014) <DOI:10.1080/00401706.2013.842935> for analyzing multi-fidelity computer
    outputs. This function computes the maximum likelihood estimates for the model parameters
    as well as the predictive means and variances of the exact solution (i.e., the conceptually
    highest fidelity).
