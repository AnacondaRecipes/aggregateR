  summary: A comprehensive collection of functions for conducting meta-analyses in R. The package
    includes functions to calculate various effect sizes or outcome measures, fit equal-,
    fixed-, random-, and mixed-effects models to such data, carry out moderator and
    meta-regression analyses, and create various types of meta-analytical plots (e.g.,
    forest, funnel, radial, L'Abbe, Baujat, bubble, and GOSH plots). For meta-analyses
    of binomial and person-time data, the package also provides functions that implement
    specialized methods, including the Mantel-Haenszel method, Peto's method, and a
    variety of suitable generalized linear (mixed-effects) models (i.e., mixed-effects
    logistic and Poisson regression models). Finally, the package provides functionality
    for fitting meta-analytic multivariate/multilevel models that account for non-independent
    sampling errors and/or true effects (e.g., due to the inclusion of multiple treatment
    studies, multiple endpoints, or other forms of clustering). Network meta-analyses
    and meta-analyses accounting for known correlation structures (e.g., due to phylogenetic
    relatedness) can also be conducted. An introduction to the package can be found
    in Viechtbauer (2010) <doi:10.18637/jss.v036.i03>.
