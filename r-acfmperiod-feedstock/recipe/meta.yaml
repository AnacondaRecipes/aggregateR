  summary: Non-robust and robust computations of the sample autocovariance (ACOVF) and sample
    autocorrelation functions (ACF) of univariate and multivariate processes. The methodology
    consists in reversing the diagonalization procedure involving the periodogram or
    the cross-periodogram and the Fourier transform vectors, and, thus, obtaining the
    ACOVF or the ACF as discussed in Fuller (1995) <doi:10.1002/9780470316917>. The
    robust version is obtained by fitting robust M-regressors to obtain the M-periodogram
    or M-cross-periodogram as discussed in Reisen et al. (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.jspi.2017.02.008>.
