  summary: Access and manipulate 'Microsoft Word' and 'Microsoft PowerPoint' documents from R.  The
    package focuses on tabular and graphical reporting from R; it also provides two
    functions that let users get document content into data objects. A set of functions  lets
    add and remove images, tables and paragraphs of text in new or existing documents.  When
    working with 'PowerPoint' presentations, slides can be added or removed; shapes
    inside  slides can also be added or removed. When working with 'Word' documents,
    a cursor can be  used to help insert or delete content at a specific location in
    the document. The package  does not require any installation of Microsoft products
    to be able to write Microsoft files.
