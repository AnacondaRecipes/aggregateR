  summary: Based on Dutta et al. (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.jempfin.2018.02.004>, this package provides
    their standardized test for abnormal returns in long-horizon event studies. The
    methods used improve the major weaknesses of size, power, and robustness of long-run
    statistical tests described in Kothari/Warner (2007) <doi:10.1016/B978-0-444-53265-7.50015-9>.
    Abnormal returns are weighted by their statistical precision (i.e., standard deviation),
    resulting in abnormal standardized returns. This procedure efficiently captures
    the heteroskedasticity problem. Clustering techniques following Cameron et al. (2011)
    <doi:10.1198/jbes.2010.07136> are adopted for computing cross-sectional correlation
    robust standard errors. The statistical tests in this package therefore accounts
    for potential biases arising from returns' cross-sectional correlation, autocorrelation,
    and volatility clustering without power loss.
