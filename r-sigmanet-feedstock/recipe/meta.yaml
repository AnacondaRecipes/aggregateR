  summary: Create interactive graph visualizations using 'Sigma.js' <http://sigmajs.org/>.  This
    package is meant to be used in conjunction with 'igraph', replacing the (somewhat
    underwhelming) plotting features of the package.  The idea is to quickly render
    graphs, regardless of their size, in a way that allows for easy, iterative modification
    of aesthetics.  Because  'Sigma.js' is a 'javascript' library, the visualizations
    are inherently interactive and are well suited for integration with 'Shiny' apps.  While
    there are several 'htmlwidgets' focused on network visualization, they tend to underperform
    on  medium to large sized graphs.  'Sigma.js' was designed for larger network visualizations
    and this package aims to  make those strengths available to 'R' users.
