  summary: Datasets are collected here for differentially (up- and down-) expressed proteins
    identified in proteomic studies of cancer and in cell culture experiments. Tables
    of amino acid compositions of proteins are used for calculations of chemical composition,
    projected into selected basis species. Plotting functions are used to visualize
    the compositional differences and thermodynamic potentials for proteomic transformations.
