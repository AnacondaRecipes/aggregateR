  summary: Chemical metrics of differentially expressed proteins in cancer and cell culture proteomics
    experiments. Data files in the package have amino acid compositions of proteins
    obtained from UniProt and >250 published lists of up- and down-regulated proteins
    in different cancer types and laboratory experiments. Functions are provided to
    calculate chemical metrics including protein length, grand average of hydropathicity
    (GRAVY), isoelectric point (pI), carbon oxidation state, and stoichiometric hydration
    state; the latter two are described in Dick et al. (2020) <doi:10.5194/bg-17-6145-2020>.
    The vignettes visualize differences of chemical metrics between up- and down-regulated
    proteins and list literature references for all datasets.
