  summary: Classical methods for combining summary data from genome-wide association studies
    (GWAS) only use marginal genetic effects and power can be compromised in the presence
    of heterogeneity. 'subgxe' is a R package that implements p-value assisted subset
    testing for association (pASTA), a method developed by Yu et al. (2019) <doi:10.1159/000496867>.
    pASTA generalizes association analysis based on subsets by incorporating gene-environment
    interactions into the testing procedure.
