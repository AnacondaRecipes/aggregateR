  summary: Market area models are used to analyze and predict store choices and market areas
    concerning retail and service locations. This package implements two market area
    models (Huff Model, Multiplicative Competitive Interaction Model) into R, while
    the emphases lie on 1.) fitting these models based on empirical data via OLS regression
    and nonlinear techniques and 2.) data preparation and processing (esp. interaction
    matrices and data preparation for the MCI Model).
