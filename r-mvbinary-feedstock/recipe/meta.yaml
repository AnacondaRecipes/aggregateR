  summary: Modelling Multivariate Binary Data with Blocks of Specific One-Factor Distribution.
    Variables are grouped into independent blocks. Each variable is described by two
    continuous parameters (its marginal probability and its dependency strength with
    the other block variables), and one binary parameter (positive or negative dependency).
    Model selection consists in the estimation of the repartition of the variables into
    blocks. It is carried out by the maximization of the BIC criterion by a deterministic
    (faster) algorithm or by a stochastic (more time consuming but optimal) algorithm.
    Tool functions facilitate the model interpretation.
