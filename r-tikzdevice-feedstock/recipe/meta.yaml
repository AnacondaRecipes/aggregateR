  summary: Provides a graphics output device for R that records plots in a LaTeX-friendly format.
    The device transforms plotting commands issued by R functions into LaTeX code blocks.
    When included in a LaTeX document, these blocks are interpreted with the help of
    'TikZ'---a graphics package for TeX and friends written by Till Tantau. Using the
    'tikzDevice', the text of R plots can contain LaTeX commands such as mathematical
    formula. The device also allows arbitrary LaTeX code to be inserted into the output
    stream.
