  summary: Functions to convert Rd to 'roxygen' documentation. It can parse an Rd file to a list,
    create the 'roxygen' documentation and update the original R script (e.g. the one
    containing the definition of the function) accordingly. This package also provides
    utilities that can help developers build packages using 'roxygen' more easily. The
    'formatR' package can be used to reformat the R code in the examples sections so
    that the code will be more readable.
