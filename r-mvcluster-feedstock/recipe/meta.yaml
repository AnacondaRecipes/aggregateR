  summary: 'Implementation of multi-view bi-clustering algorithms. When a sample is characterized
    by two or more sets of input features, it creates multiple data matrices for the
    same set of examples, each corresponding to a view. For instance, individuals who
    are diagnosed with a disorder can be described by their clinical symptoms (one view)
    and their genomic markers (another view). Rows of a data matrix correspond to examples
    and columns correspond to features. A multi-view bi-clustering algorithm groups
    examples (rows) consistently across the views and simultaneously identifies the
    subset of features (columns) in each view that are associated with the row groups.
    This mvcluster package includes three such methods. (1) MVSVDL1: multi-view bi-clustering
    based on singular value decomposition where the left singular vectors are used to
    identify row clusters and the right singular vectors are used to identify features
    (columns) for each row cluster. Each singular vector is regularized by the L1 vector
    norm.  (2) MVLRRL0: multi-view bi-clustering based on sparse low rank representation
    (i.e., matrix approximation) where the decomposed components are regularized by
    the so-called L0 vector norm (which is not really a vector norm). (3) MVLRRL1: multi-view
    bi-clustering based on sparse low rank representation (i.e., matrix approximation)
    where the decomposed components are regularized by the L1 vector norm.    '
