  summary: Visualise sequential distributions using a range of plotting styles. Sequential distribution
    data can be input as either simulations or values corresponding to percentiles over
    time. Plots are added to existing graphic devices using the fan function. Users
    can choose from four different styles, including fan chart type plots, where a set
    of coloured polygon, with shadings corresponding to the percentile values are layered
    to represent different uncertainty levels.
