  summary: 'An implementation of multiple maps t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE).
    Multiple maps t-SNE is a method for projecting high-dimensional data into several
    low-dimensional maps such that non-metric space properties are better preserved
    than they would be by a single map. Multiple maps t-SNE with only one map is equivalent
    to standard t-SNE. When projecting onto more than one map, multiple maps t-SNE estimates
    a set of latent weights that allow each point to contribute to one or more maps
    depending on similarity relationships in the original data. This implementation
    is a port of the original ''Matlab'' library by Laurens van der Maaten.  See Van
    der Maaten and Hinton (2012) <doi:10.1007/s10994-011-5273-4>. This material is based
