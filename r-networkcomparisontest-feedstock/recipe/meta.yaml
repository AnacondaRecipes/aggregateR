  summary: This permutation based hypothesis test, suited for several types of data supported
    by the estimateNetwork function of the bootnet package (Epskamp & Fried, 2018),
    assesses the difference between two networks based on several invariance measures
    (network structure invariance, global strength invariance, edge invariance, several
    centrality measures, etc.). Network structures are estimated with l1-regularization.
    The Network Comparison Test is suited for comparison of independent (e.g., two different
    groups) and dependent samples (e.g., one group that is measured twice). See van
    Borkulo et al. (2021), available from <doi:10.1037/met0000476>.
