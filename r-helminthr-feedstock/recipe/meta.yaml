  summary: Access to large host-parasite data is often hampered by the availability of data and
    difficulty in obtaining it in a programmatic way to encourage analyses. 'helminthR'
    provides a programmatic interface to the London Natural History Museum's host-parasite
    database, one of the largest host-parasite databases existing currently <https://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/scientific-resources/taxonomy-systematics/host-parasites/>.
    The package allows the user to query by host species, parasite species, and geographic
