  summary: Provides to sociologists (and related scientists) a toolbox to facilitate the construction
    of social position indicators from survey data. Social position indicators refer
    to what is commonly known as social class and social status. There exists in the
    sociological literature many theoretical conceptualisation and empirical operationalization
    of social class and social status. This first version of the package offers tools
    to construct the International Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status (ISEI)
    and the Oesch social class schema. It also provides tools to convert several occupational
    classifications (PCS82, PCS03, and ISCO08) into a common one (ISCO88) to facilitate
    data harmonisation work, and tools to collapse (i.e. group) modalities of social
    position indicators.
