  summary: Estimation of optimal portfolio weights as combination of simple portfolio strategies,
    like the tangency, global minimum variance (GMV) or naive (1/N) portfolio. It is
    based on a utility maximizing 8-fund rule. Popular special cases like the Kan-Zhou(2007)
    2-fund and 3-fund rule or the Tu-Zhou(2011) estimator are nested.
