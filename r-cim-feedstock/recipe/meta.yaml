  summary: 'Produces statistical indicators of the impact of migration on the socio-demographic
    composition of an area. Three measures can be used: ratios, percentages and the
    Duncan index of dissimilarity. The input data files are assumed to be in an  origin-destination
    matrix format, with each cell representing a flow count between an origin and a
    destination area. Columns are expected to represent origins, and rows are expected
    to represent destinations. The first row and column are assumed to contain labels
    for each area. See Rodriguez-Vignoli and Rowe (2018) <doi:10.1080/00324728.2017.1416155>
