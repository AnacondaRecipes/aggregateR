  summary: "A process-oriented and trajectory-based Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) package for
    R. It is designed as a generic yet powerful framework. The architecture encloses
    a robust and fast simulation core written in 'C++' with automatic monitoring capabilities.
    It provides a rich and flexible R API that revolves around the concept of trajectory,
    a common path in the simulation model for entities of the same type. Documentation
    about 'simmer' is provided by several vignettes included in this package, via the
    paper by Ucar, Smeets & Azcorra (2019, <doi:10.18637/jss.v090.i02>), and the paper
    by Ucar, Hern\xE1ndez, Serrano & Azcorra (2018, <doi:10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700960>);
