  summary: Functions for eleven procedures for determining the number of factors, including functions
    for parallel analysis and the minimum average partial test. There are also functions
    for conducting principal components analysis, principal axis factor analysis, maximum
    likelihood factor analysis, image factor analysis, and extension factor analysis,
    all of which can take raw data or correlation matrices as input and with options
    for conducting the analyses using Pearson correlations, Kendall correlations, Spearman
    correlations, gamma correlations, or polychoric correlations. Varimax rotation,
    promax rotation, and Procrustes rotations can be performed. Additional functions
    focus on the factorability of a correlation matrix, the congruences between factors
    from different datasets, the assessment of local independence, the assessment of
    factor solution complexity, and internal consistency. Auerswald & Moshagen (2019,
