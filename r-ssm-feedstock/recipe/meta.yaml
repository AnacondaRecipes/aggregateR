  summary: Creates an S4 class "SSM" and defines functions for fitting smooth supersaturated
    models, a polynomial model with spline-like behaviour. Functions are defined for
    the computation of Sobol indices for sensitivity analysis and plotting the main
    effects using FANOVA methods. It also implements the estimation of the SSM metamodel
    error using a GP model with a variety of defined correlation functions.
