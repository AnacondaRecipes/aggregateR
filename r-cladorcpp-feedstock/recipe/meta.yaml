  summary: 'Various cladogenesis-related calculations that are slow in pure R are implemented
    in C++ with Rcpp. These include the calculation of the probability of various scenarios
    for the inheritance of geographic range at the divergence events on a phylogenetic
    tree, and other calculations necessary for models which are not continuous-time
    markov chains (CTMC), but where change instead occurs instantaneously at speciation
    events.  Typically these models must assess the probability of every possible combination
    of (ancestor state, left descendent state, right descendent state).  This means
    that there are up to (# of states)^3 combinations to investigate, and in biogeographical
    models, there can easily be hundreds of states, so calculation time becomes an issue.  C++
    implementation plus clever tricks (many combinations can be eliminated a priori)
    can greatly speed the computation time over naive R implementations.  CITATION INFO:
