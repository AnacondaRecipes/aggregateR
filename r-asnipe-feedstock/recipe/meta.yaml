  summary: 'Implements several tools that are used in animal social network analysis, as described
    in Whitehead (2007) Analyzing Animal Societies <University of Chicago Press> and
    Farine & Whitehead (2015) <doi: 10.1111/1365-2656.12418>. In particular, this package
    provides the tools to infer groups and generate networks from observation data,
    perform permutation tests on the data, calculate lagged association rates, and performed
    multiple regression analysis on social network data.'
