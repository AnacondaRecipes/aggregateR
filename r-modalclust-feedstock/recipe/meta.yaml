  summary: Performs Modal Clustering (MAC) including Hierarchical Modal Clustering (HMAC) along
    with their parallel implementation (PHMAC) over several processors.  These model-based
    non-parametric clustering techniques can extract  clusters in very high dimensions
    with arbitrary density shapes. By default clustering is performed over several resolutions
    and the results are summarised as a hierarchical tree. Associated plot functions
    are also provided. There is a package vignette that provides many examples. This
    version adheres to CRAN policy of not spanning more than two child processes by
    default.
