  summary: 'A compilation of functions for performing calculations and creating plots that commonly
    arise in geotechnical engineering and soil mechanics. The types of calculations
    that are currently included are: (1) phase diagrams and index parameters, (2) grain-size
    distributions,  (3) plasticity, (4) soil classification, (5) compaction, (6) groundwater,
    (7) subsurface stresses (geostatic and induced), (8) Mohr circle analyses, (9) consolidation
    settlement and rate, (10) shear strength, (11) bearing capacity, (12) lateral earth
    pressures, (13) slope stability, and (14) subsurface explorations. Geotechnical
    engineering students, educators, researchers, and practitioners will find this package
    useful.'
