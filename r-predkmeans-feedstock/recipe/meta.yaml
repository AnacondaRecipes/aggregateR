  summary: Implements the predictive k-means method for clustering observations, using a mixture
    of experts model to allow covariates to influence cluster centers. Motivated by
    air pollution epidemiology settings, where cluster membership needs to be predicted
    across space. Includes functions for predicting cluster membership using spatial
    splines and principal component analysis (PCA) scores using either multinomial logistic
    regression or support vector machines (SVMs). For method details see Keller et al.
    (2017) <doi:10.1214/16-AOAS992>.
