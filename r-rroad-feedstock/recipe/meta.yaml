  summary: 'Computation of the International Roughness Index (IRI) given a longitudinal road
    profile. The IRI can be calculated for a single road segment or for a sequence of
    segments with a fixed length (e. g. 100m). For the latter, an overlap of the segments
    can be selected. The IRI and likewise the algorithms for its determination are defined
