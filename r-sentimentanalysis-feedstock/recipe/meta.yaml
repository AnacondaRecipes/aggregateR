  summary: Performs a sentiment analysis of textual contents in R. This implementation utilizes
    various existing dictionaries, such as Harvard IV, or finance-specific dictionaries.
    Furthermore, it can also create customized dictionaries. The latter uses LASSO regularization
    as a statistical approach to select relevant terms based on an exogenous response
    variable.
