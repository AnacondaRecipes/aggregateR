  summary: Computes the t* statistic corresponding to the tau* population coefficient introduced
    by Bergsma and Dassios (2014) <DOI:10.3150/13-BEJ514> and does so in O(n^2) time
    following the algorithm of Heller and Heller (2016) <arXiv:1605.08732> building
    off of the work of Weihs, Drton, and Leung (2016) <DOI:10.1007/s00180-015-0639-x>.
    Also allows for independence testing using the asymptotic distribution of t* as
    described by Nandy, Weihs, and Drton (2016) <arXiv:1602.04387>.
