  summary: Collective matrix factorization (CMF) finds joint low-rank representations for a collection
    of matrices with shared row or column entities. This code learns variational Bayesian
    approximation for CMF, supporting multiple likelihood potentials and missing data,
    while identifying both factors shared by multiple matrices and factors private for
    each matrix.
