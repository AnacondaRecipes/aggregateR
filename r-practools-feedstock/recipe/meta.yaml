  summary: Functions and datasets to support Valliant, Dever, and Kreuter, Practical Tools for
    Designing and Weighting Survey Samples (2nd edition, 2018). Contains functions for
    sample size calculation for survey samples using stratified or clustered one-, two-,
    and three-stage sample designs. Other functions compute variance components for
    multistage designs and sample sizes in two-phase designs. A number of example data
    sets are included.
