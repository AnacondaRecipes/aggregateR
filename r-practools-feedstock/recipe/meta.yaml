  summary: Functions and datasets to support Valliant, Dever, and Kreuter, ``Practical Tools
    for Designing and Weighting Survey Samples'' (2nd edition, 2018). Contains functions
    for sample size calculation for survey samples using stratified or clustered one-,
    two-, and three-stage sample designs. Other functions compute variance components
    for multistage designs and sample sizes in two-phase designs. A number of example
    data sets are included.
