  summary: HTML tables are a valuable data source but extracting and recasting these data into
    a useful format can be tedious. This package allows to collect structured information
    from HTML tables. It is similar to readHTMLTable() of the XML package but provides
    three major advantages. First, the function automatically expands row and column
    spans in the header and body cells. Second, users are given more control over the
    identification of header and body rows which will end up in the R table, including
    semantic header information that appear throughout the body. Third, the function
    preprocesses table code, corrects common types of malformations, removes unneeded
    parts and so helps to alleviate the need for tedious post-processing.
