  summary: ccChooser can be used to developing and evaluation of core collections for germplasm
    collections (entire collection). This package used to develop a core collection
    for biological resources like genbanks. A core collection is defined as a sample
    of accessions that represent, with the lowest possible level of redundancy, the
    genetic diversity (the richness of gene or genotype categories) of the entire collection.
    The establishing a core collection that represents genetic diversity of the entire
    collection with minimum loss of its original diversity and minimum redundancies
    is an important problem for gene-banks curators and crop breeders. ccChooser establish
    core collection base on phenotypic data (agronomic, morphological, phenological).
