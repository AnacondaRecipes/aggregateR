  summary: Allows users to learn undirected and directed (causal) graphs over mixed data types
    (i.e., continuous and discrete variables). To learn a directed graph over mixed
    data, it first calculates the undirected graph (Sedgewick et al, 2016) and then
    it uses local search strategies to prune-and-orient this graph (Sedgewick et al,
    2017). AJ Sedgewick, I Shi, RM Donovan, PV Benos (2016) <doi:10.1186/s12859-016-1039-0>.
