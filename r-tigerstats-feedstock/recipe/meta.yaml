  summary: A collection of data sets and functions that are useful in the teaching of statistics
    at an elementary level to students who may have little or no previous experience
    with the command line.  The functions for elementary inferential procedures follow
    a uniform interface for user input.  Some of the functions are instructional applets
    that can only be run on the R Studio integrated development environment with package
    'manipulate' installed.  Other instructional applets are Shiny apps that may be
    run locally. In teaching the package is used alongside of package 'mosaic', 'mosaicData'
    and 'abd', which are therefore listed as dependencies.
