  summary: An algorithm for general-purpose unconstrained non-linear optimization. The algorithm
    is of quasi-Newton type with BFGS updating of the inverse Hessian and soft line
    search with a trust region type monitoring of the input to the line search algorithm.
    The interface of 'ucminf' is designed for easy interchange with 'optim'.
