  summary: Performs prediction of a response function from simulated response values, allowing
    black-box optimization of functions estimated with some error. Includes a simple
    user interface for such applications, as well as more specialized functions designed
    to be called by the Migraine software (Rousset and Leblois, 2012 <doi:10.1093/molbev/MSR262>;
    Leblois et al., 2014 <doi:10.1093/molbev/msu212>; and see URL). The latter functions
    are used for prediction of likelihood surfaces and implied likelihood ratio confidence
    intervals, and for exploration of predictor space of the surface. Prediction of
    the response is based on ordinary Kriging (with residual error) of the input. Estimation
    of smoothing parameters is performed by generalized cross-validation.
