  summary: An implementation of a method based on information theory devised  for the identification
    of genes showing a significant variation of expression across multiple conditions.
    Given expression estimates from any number of  RNA-Seq samples and conditions it
    identifies genes or transcripts with a  significant variation of expression across
    all the conditions studied,  together with the samples in which they are over- or
    under-expressed.  Zambelli et al. (2018) <doi:10.1093/nar/gky055>.
