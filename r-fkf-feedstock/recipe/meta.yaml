  summary: This is a fast and flexible implementation of the Kalman filter and smoother, which
    can deal with NAs. It is entirely written in C and relies fully on linear algebra
    subroutines contained in BLAS and LAPACK. Due to the speed of the filter, the fitting
    of high-dimensional linear state space models to large datasets becomes possible.
    This package also contains a plot function for the visualization of the state vector
    and graphical diagnostics of the residuals.
