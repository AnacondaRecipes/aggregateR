  summary: 'Variable selection from random forests using both backwards variable elimination
    (for the selection of small sets of non-redundant variables) and selection based
    on the importance spectrum (somewhat similar to scree plots; for the selection of
    large, potentially highly-correlated variables). Main applications in high-dimensional
    data (e.g., microarray data, and other genomics and proteomics applications). '
