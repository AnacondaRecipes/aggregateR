  summary: 'Routines to find the root of nonlinear functions, and to perform steady-state and
    equilibrium analysis of ordinary differential equations (ODE).  Includes routines
    that: (1) generate gradient and jacobian matrices (full and banded), (2) find roots
    of non-linear equations by the ''Newton-Raphson'' method,  (3) estimate steady-state
    conditions of a system of (differential) equations in full, banded or sparse form,
    using the ''Newton-Raphson'' method, or by dynamically running, (4) solve the steady-state
    conditions for uni-and multicomponent 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D partial differential equations,
    that have been converted to ordinary differential equations by numerical differencing
    (using the method-of-lines approach). Includes fortran code.'
