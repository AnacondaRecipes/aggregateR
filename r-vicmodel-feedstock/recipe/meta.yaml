  summary: 'The Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model is a macroscale hydrologic model that
    solves full water and energy balances, originally developed by Xu Liang at the University
    of Washington (UW). The version of VIC source code used is of 5.0.1 on <https://github.com/UW-Hydro/VIC/>,
    see Hamman et al. (2018). Development and maintenance of the current official version
    of the VIC model at present is led by the UW Hydro (Computational Hydrology group)
    in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at UW. VIC is a research
    model and in its various forms it has been applied to most of the major river basins
    around the world, as well as globally. If you make use of this model, please acknowledge
    the appropriate references listed in the help page of this package or on the references
    page <http://vic.readthedocs.io/en/master/Documentation/References/> of the VIC
    official documentation website. These should include Liang et al. (1994) plus any
