  summary: This is a bare-bones implementation of sampling algorithms for a variety of Bayesian
    stick-breaking (marginally DP) mixture models, including particle learning and Gibbs
    sampling for static DP mixtures, particle learning for dynamic BAR stick-breaking,
    and DP mixture regression.  The software is designed to be easy to customize to
    suit different situations and for experimentation with stick-breaking models.  Since
    particles are repeatedly copied, it is not an especially efficient implementation.
