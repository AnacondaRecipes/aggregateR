  summary: Implement in 'R' interactive Circos-like visualizations of genomic data, to map information
    such as genetic variants, genomic fusions and aberrations to a circular genome,
    as proposed by the 'JavaScript' library 'BioCircos.js', based on the 'JQuery' and
    'D3' technologies. The output is by default displayed in stand-alone HTML documents
    or in the 'RStudio' viewer pane. Moreover it can be integrated in 'R Markdown' documents
    and 'Shiny' applications.
