  summary: In competing risks regression, the proportional subdistribution hazards(PSH) model
    is popular for its direct assessment of covariate effects on the cumulative incidence
    function. This package allows for penalized variable selection for the PSH model.
    Penalties include LASSO, SCAD, MCP, and their group versions.
