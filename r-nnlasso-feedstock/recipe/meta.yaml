  summary: Estimates of coefficients of lasso penalized linear regression and generalized linear
    models subject to non-negativity constraints on the parameters using multiplicative
    iterative algorithm. Entire regularization path for a sequence of lambda values
    can be obtained. Functions are available for creating plots of regularization path,
    cross validation and estimating coefficients at a given lambda value. There is also
    provision for obtaining standard error of coefficient estimates.
