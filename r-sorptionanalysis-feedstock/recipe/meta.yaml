  summary: 'Provides tools to efficiently analyze and visualize laboratory data from aqueous
    static adsorption experiments. The package provides functions to plot Langmuir,
    Freundlich, and Temkin isotherms and functions to determine the statistical conformity
    of data points to the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin adsorption models through
    statistical characterization of the isothermic least squares regressions lines.
