  summary: Fits a Gaussian process model to data. Gaussian processes are commonly used in computer
    experiments to fit an interpolating model. The model is stored as an 'R6' object
    and can be easily updated with new data. There are options to run in parallel, and
    'Rcpp' has been used to speed up calculations. For more info about Gaussian process
    software, see Erickson et al. (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.ejor.2017.10.002>.
