  summary: Implements latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and related models.  This includes (but
    is not limited to) sLDA, corrLDA, and the mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel.  Inference
    for all of these models is implemented via a fast collapsed Gibbs sampler written
    in C.  Utility functions for reading/writing data typically used in topic models,
    as well as tools for examining posterior distributions are also included.
