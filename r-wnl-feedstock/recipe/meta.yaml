  summary: This is a set of minimization tools (maximum likelihood estimation and least square
    fitting) to solve examples in the Johan Gabrielsson and Dan Weiner's book "Pharmacokinetic
    and Pharmacodynamic Data Analysis - Concepts and Applications" 5th ed. (ISBN:9198299107).
    Examples include linear and nonlinear compartmental model, turn-over model, single
    or multiple dosing bolus/infusion/oral models, allometry, toxicokinetics, reversible
    metabolism, in-vitro/in-vivo extrapolation, enterohepatic circulation, metabolite
    modeling, Emax model, inhibitory model, tolerance model, oscillating response model,
    enantiomer interaction model, effect compartment model, drug-drug interaction model,
    receptor occupancy model, and rebound phenomena model.
