  summary: Provides classes and methods for objects, whose indexing naturally starts from zero.
    Subsetting, indexing and mathematical operations are defined naturally between lagged
    objects and lagged and base R objects. Recycling is not used, except for singletons.
    The single bracket operator doesn't drop dimensions by default.
