  license: MIT
  summary: Provides a set of functions to make tracking the hidden movements  of the 'Jack' player
    easier. By tracking every possible path Jack might have  traveled from the point
    of the initial murder including special movement such  as through alleyways and
    via carriages, the police can more accurately narrow  the field of their search.
    Additionally, by tracking all possible hideouts from  round to round, rounds 3 and
    4 should have a vastly reduced field of search.
