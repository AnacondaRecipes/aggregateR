  summary: Makes the qhull library (www.qhull.org) available in R, in a similar manner as in
    Octave and MATLAB. Qhull computes convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations, halfspace
    intersections about a point, Voronoi diagrams, furthest-site Delaunay triangulations,
    and furthest-site Voronoi diagrams. It runs in 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, and higher dimensions.
    It implements the Quickhull algorithm for computing the convex hull. Qhull does
    not support constrained Delaunay triangulations, or mesh generation of non-convex
    objects, but the package does include some R functions that allow for this. Currently
    the package only gives access to Delaunay triangulation and convex hull computation.
