  summary: Measuring angles between points in a landscape is much easier than measuring distances.
    When the location of three points is known the position of the observer can be determined
    based solely on the angles between these points as seen by the observer. This task
    (known as triangulation) however requires onerous calculations - these calculations
    are automated by this package.
