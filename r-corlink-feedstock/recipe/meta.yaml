  summary: A matrix of agreement patterns and counts for record pairs is the input for the procedure.  An
    EM algorithm is used to impute plausible values for missing record pairs.  A second
    EM algorithm, incorporating possible correlations between per-field agreement, is
    used to estimate posterior probabilities that each pair is a true match - i.e. constitutes
    the same individual.
