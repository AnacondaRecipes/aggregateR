  summary: Package GB2 explores the Generalized Beta distribution of the second kind. Density,
    cumulative distribution function, quantiles and moments of the distributions are
    given. Functions for the full log-likelihood, the profile log-likelihood and the
    scores are provided. Formulas for various indicators of inequality and poverty under
    the GB2 are implemented. The GB2 is fitted by the methods of maximum pseudo-likelihood
    estimation using the full and profile log-likelihood, and non-linear least squares
    estimation of the model parameters. Various plots for the visualization and analysis
    of the results are provided. Variance estimation of the parameters is provided for
    the method of maximum pseudo-likelihood estimation. A mixture distribution based
    on the compounding property of the GB2 is presented (denoted as "compound" in the
    documentation). This mixture distribution is based on the discretization of the
    distribution of the underlying random scale parameter. The discretization can be
    left or right tail. Density, cumulative distribution function, moments and quantiles
    for the mixture distribution are provided. The compound mixture distribution is
    fitted using the method of maximum pseudo-likelihood estimation. The fit can also
    incorporate the use of auxiliary information. In this new version of the package,
    the mixture case is complemented with new functions for variance estimation by linearization
    and comparative density plots.
