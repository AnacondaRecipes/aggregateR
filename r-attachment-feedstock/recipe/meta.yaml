  summary: Manage dependencies during package development. This can retrieve all dependencies
    that are used in ".R" files in the "R/" directory, in ".Rmd" files in "vignettes/"
    directory and in 'roxygen2' documentation of functions. There is a function to update
    the "DESCRIPTION" file of your package with 'CRAN' packages or any other remote
    package.  All functions to retrieve dependencies of ".R" scripts and ".Rmd" or ".qmd"
    files can be used independently of a package development.
