  summary: Tools to help manage dependencies during package development.  This can retrieve all
    dependencies that are used in R files in the "R" directory, in Rmd files in "vignettes"
    directory and in 'roxygen2' documentation of functions. There is a function to update
    the Description file of your package and a function to create a file with the R
    commands to install all dependencies of your package. All functions to retrieve
    dependencies of R scripts and Rmd files can be used independently of a package development.
