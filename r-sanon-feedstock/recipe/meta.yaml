  summary: There are several functions to implement the method for analysis in a randomized clinical
    trial with strata with following key features. A stratified Mann-Whitney estimator
    addresses the comparison between two randomized groups for a strictly ordinal response
    variable. The multivariate vector of such stratified Mann-Whitney estimators for
    multivariate response variables can be considered for one or more response variables
    such as in repeated measurements and these can have missing completely at random
    (MCAR) data. Non-parametric covariance adjustment is also considered with the minimal
    assumption of randomization. The p-value for hypothesis test and confidence interval
    are provided.
