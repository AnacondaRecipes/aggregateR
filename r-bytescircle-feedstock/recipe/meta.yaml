  summary: 'Shows statistics about bytes contained in a file as a circle graph of deviations
    from mean in sigma increments. The function can be useful for statistically analyze
    the content of files in a glimpse: text files are shown as a green centered crown,
    compressed and encrypted files should be shown as equally distributed variations
    with a very low CV (sigma/mean), and other types of files can be classified between
    these two categories depending on their text vs binary content, which can be useful
    to quickly determine how information is stored inside them (databases, multimedia
    files, etc).'
