  summary: Automates many of the tasks associated with quantitative discourse analysis of transcripts
    containing discourse including frequency counts of sentence types, words, sentences,
    turns of talk, syllables and other assorted analysis tasks. The package provides
    parsing tools for preparing transcript data. Many functions enable the user to aggregate
    data by any number of grouping variables, providing analysis and seamless integration
    with other R packages that undertake higher level analysis and visualization of
    text. This affords the user a more efficient and targeted analysis. 'qdap' is designed
    for transcript analysis, however, many functions are applicable to other areas of
    Text Mining/ Natural Language Processing.
