  summary: Algorithms for accelerating the convergence of slow, monotone sequences from smooth,
    contraction mapping such as the EM and MM algorithms. It can be used to accelerate
    any smooth, linearly convergent acceleration scheme.  A tutorial style introduction
    to this package is available in a vignette on the CRAN download page or, when the
    package is loaded in an R session, with vignette("turboEM").
