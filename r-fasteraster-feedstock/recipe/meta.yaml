  summary: 'If there is a need to recognise edges on a raster image or a bitmap or any kind of
    a matrix, one can find packages that does only 90 degrees vectorization. Typically
    the nature of artefact images is linear and can be vectorized in much more efficient
    way than draw a series of 90 degrees lines. The fasteraster package does recognition
    of lines using only one pass. It also allows to calculate mass and the mass centers
    for the recognized zones or polygons. '
