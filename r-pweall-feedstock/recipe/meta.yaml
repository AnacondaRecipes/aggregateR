  summary: Calculates various functions needed for design and monitoring survival trials accounting
    for complex situations such as delayed treatment effect, treatment crossover, non-uniform
    accrual, and different censoring distributions between groups. The event time distribution
    is assumed to be piecewise exponential (PWE) distribution and the entry time is
    assumed to be piecewise uniform distribution. As compared with Version 1.2.1, two
    more types of hybrid crossover are added. A bug is corrected in the function "pwecx"
    that calculates the crossover-adjusted survival, distribution, density, hazard and
    cumulative hazard functions. Also, to generate the crossover-adjusted event time
    random variable,  a more efficient algorithm is used and the output includes crossover
    indicators.
