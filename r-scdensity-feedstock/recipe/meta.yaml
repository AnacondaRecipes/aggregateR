  summary: Implements methods for obtaining kernel density estimates subject to a variety of
    shape constraints (unimodality, bimodality,  symmetry, tail monotonicity, bounds,
    and constraints on the number of  inflection points). Enforcing constraints can
    eliminate unwanted waves or  kinks in the estimate, which improves its subjective
    appearance and can  also improve statistical performance. The main function scdensity()
    is  very similar to the density() function in 'stats', allowing  shape-restricted
    estimates to be obtained with little effort. The  methods implemented in this package
    are described in Wolters and Braun  (2017) <doi:10.1080/03610918.2017.1288247>,
    Wolters (2012)  <doi:10.18637/jss.v047.i06>, and Hall and Huang (2002)  <http://www3.stat.sinica.edu.tw/statistica/j12n4/j12n41/j12n41.htm>.   See
