  summary: 'Discretize AR(1) process following Tauchen (1986) <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0165176586901680>.
    A discrete Markov chain that approximates in the sense of weak convergence a continuous-valued
    univariate Autoregressive process of first order is generated. It is a popular method
    used in economics and in finance. '
