  summary: This package provides R with access to Boost Date_Time functionality by using Rcpp
    modules.  . Functionality from Boost Date_Time for dates, durations (both for days  and
    datetimes), timezones, and posix time ("ptime") is provided. The posix time implementation
    can support high-resolution of up to nano-second precision by using 96 bits (instead
    of R's 64) to present a ptime object.
