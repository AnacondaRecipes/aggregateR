  summary: Provides nonparametric CUSUM tests for detecting changes in possibly serially dependent
    univariate or low-dimensional multivariate observations. Retrospective tests sensitive
    to changes in the expectation, the variance, the covariance, the autocovariance,
    the distribution function, Spearman's rho, Kendall's tau, Gini's mean difference,
    and the copula are provided, as well as a test for detecting changes in the distribution
    of independent block maxima (with environmental studies in mind). The package also
    contains a test sensitive to changes in the autocopula and a combined test of stationarity
    sensitive to changes in the distribution function and the autocopula. The latest
    additions are an open-end sequential test based on the retrospective CUSUM statistic
    that can be used for monitoring changes in the mean of possibly serially dependent
    univariate observations, as well as closed-end and open-end sequential tests based
    on empirical distribution functions that can be used for monitoring changes in the
    contemporary distribution of possibly serially dependent univariate or low-dimensional
    multivariate observations.
