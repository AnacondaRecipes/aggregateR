  summary: Provides nonparametric CUSUM tests for detecting changes in possibly serially dependent
    univariate or multivariate observations. Retrospective tests sensitive to changes
    in the expectation, the variance, the covariance, the autocovariance, the distribution
    function, Spearman's rho, Kendall's tau, Gini's mean difference, and the copula
    are provided, as well as a test for detecting changes in the distribution of independent
    block maxima (with environmental studies in mind). The package also contains a test
    sensitive to changes in the autocopula and a combined test of stationarity sensitive
    to changes in the distribution function and the autocopula. The latest additions
    are a closed-end sequential test based on empirical distribution functions that
    can be used for monitoring changes in the contemporary distribution of possibly
    serially dependent univariate or multivariate observations, and an open-end sequential
    test based on the retrospective CUSUM statistic that can be used for monitoring
    changes in the mean of possibly serially dependent univariate observations.
