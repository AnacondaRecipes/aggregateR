  summary: Provides nonparametric CUSUM tests for detecting changes in possibly serially dependent
    univariate or multivariate observations. Tests sensitive to changes in the expectation,
    the variance, the covariance, the autocovariance, the distribution function, Spearman's
    rho, Kendall's tau, Gini's mean difference, and the copula are provided, as well
    as a test for detecting changes in the distribution of independent block maxima
    (with environmental studies in mind). The latest additions are a test sensitive
    to changes in the autocopula and a combined test of stationarity sensitive to changes
    in the distribution function and the autocopula.
