  summary: Provides R functions for calculating basic effect size indices for single-case designs,
    including several non-overlap measures and parametric effect size measures, and
    for estimating the gradual effects model developed by Swan and Pustejovsky (2018)
    <DOI:10.1080/00273171.2018.1466681>. Standard errors and confidence intervals (based
    on the assumption that the outcome measurements are mutually independent) are provided
    for the subset of effect sizes indices with known sampling distributions.
