  summary: Provides the users with the ability to quickly create Linked  Micromap plots for a
    collection of geographic areas.   Linked Micromaps are visualizations of georeferenced
    data that link statistical graphics to an organized series of small maps or graphic
    images.  The Help description contains examples of how to use the micromapST function.
    Contained in this package are border group datasets to support creating micromaps
    for the  50 U.S. states and District of Columbia (51 areas), the U. S. 20 Seer Registries,  the
    105 counties in the state of Kansas, the 62 counties of New York, the 24 counties
    of Maryland, the 29 counties of Utah, the 32 administrative areas  in China, the
    218 administrative areas in the UK and Ireland (for testing only),  the 25 districts
    in the city of Seoul South Korea, and the 52 counties on the Africa  continent.
    A border group dataset contains the boundaries related to the data level areas,  a
    second layer boundaries, a top or third layer boundary, a parameter list of  run
    options, and a cross indexing table between area names, abbreviations,  numeric
    identification and alias matching strings for the specific geographic area.  By
    specifying a border group, the package create micromaps for any geographic region.  The
    user can create and provide their own border group dataset  for any area beyond
    the areas contained within the package. Copyrighted 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 by
