  summary: New tools for the imputation of missing values in high-dimensional data are introduced
    using the non-parametric nearest neighbor methods. It includes weighted nearest
    neighbor imputation methods that use specific distances for selected variables.
    It includes an automatic procedure of cross validation and does not require prespecified
    values of the tuning parameters. It can be used to impute missing values in high-dimensional
    data when the sample size is smaller than the number of predictors. For more information
    see Faisal and Tutz (2017) <doi:10.1515/sagmb-2015-0098>.
