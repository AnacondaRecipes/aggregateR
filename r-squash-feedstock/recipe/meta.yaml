  summary: Functions for color-based visualization of multivariate data, i.e. colorgrams or heatmaps.  Lower-level
    functions  map numeric values to colors, display a matrix as an array of colors,
    and draw color keys.  Higher-level plotting functions generate a bivariate histogram,
    a dendrogram aligned with a color-coded matrix, a triangular distance matrix, and
    more.
