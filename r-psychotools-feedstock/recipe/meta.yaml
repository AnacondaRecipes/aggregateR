  summary: Infrastructure for psychometric modeling such as data classes (for item response data
    and paired comparisons), basic model fitting functions (for Bradley-Terry, Rasch,
    parametric logistic IRT, generalized partial credit, rating scale, multinomial processing
    tree models), extractor functions for different types of parameters (item, person,
    threshold, discrimination, guessing, upper asymptotes), unified inference and visualizations,
    and various datasets for illustration.  Intended as a common lightweight and efficient
    toolbox for psychometric modeling and a common building block for fitting psychometric
    mixture models in package "psychomix" and trees based on psychometric models in
    package "psychotree".
