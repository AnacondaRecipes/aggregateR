  summary: 'A collection of 19 datasets from contemporary astronomical research.  They are described
    the textbook `Modern Statistical Methods for Astronomy with R Applications'' by
    Eric D. Feigelson and G. Jogesh Babu (Cambridge University Press, 2012, Appendix
    C) or on the website of Penn State''s Center for Astrostatistics (http://astrostatistics.psu.edu/datasets).  These
    datasets can be used to exercise methodology involving: density estimation; heteroscedastic
    measurement errors; contingency tables; two-sample hypothesis tests; spatial point
    processes; nonlinear regression; mixture models; censoring and truncation; multivariate
    analysis; classification and clustering; inhomogeneous Poisson processes; periodic
    and stochastic time series analysis.  '
