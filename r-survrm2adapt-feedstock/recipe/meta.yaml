  summary: Performs the procedure proposed by Horiguchi et al. (2018) <doi:10.1002/sim.7661>.
    The method specifies a set of truncation time points tau's for calculating restricted
    mean survival times (RMST), performs testing for equality, and estimates the difference
    in RMST between two groups at the specified tau's. Multiplicity by specifying several
    tau's is taken into account in this procedure.
