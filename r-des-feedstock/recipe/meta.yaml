  summary: Discrete event simulation (DES) involves modeling of systems having discrete, i.e.
    abrupt, state changes. For instance, when a job arrives to a queue, the queue length
    abruptly increases by 1.  This package is an R implementation of the event-oriented
    approach to DES; see the tutorial in Matloff (2008)  <http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/156/PLN/DESimIntro.pdf>.
