  summary: "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a highly versatile analytical technique for studying
    molecular configuration, conformation, and dynamics, especially those of biomacromolecules
    such as proteins. Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank ('BMRB') is a repository
    for Data from NMR Spectroscopy on Proteins, Peptides, Nucleic Acids, and other Biomolecules.
    Currently, 'BMRB' offers an R package 'RBMRB' to fetch data, however, it doesn't
    easily offer individual data file downloading and storing in a local directory.
    When using 'RBMRB', the data will stored as an R object, which fundamentally hinders
    the NMR researches to access the rich information from raw data, for example, the
    metadata. Here, 'BMRBr' File Downloader ('BMRBr') offers a more fundamental, low
    level downloader, which will download original deposited .str format file. This
    type of file contains information such as entry title, authors, citation, protein
    sequences, and so on. Many factors affect NMR experiment outputs, such as temperature,
    resonance sensitivity and etc., approximately 40% of the entries in the 'BMRB' have
    chemical shift accuracy problems [1,2] Unfortunately, current reference correction
    methods are heavily dependent on the availability of assigned protein chemical shifts
    or protein structure. This is my current research project is going to solve, which
    will be included in the future release of the package. The current version of the
    package is sufficient and robust enough for downloading individual 'BMRB' data file
    from the 'BMRB' database <http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu>. The functionalities of this
    package includes but not limited: * To simplifies NMR researches by combine data
    downloading and results analysis together. * To allows NMR data reaches a broader
    audience that could utilize more than just chemical shifts but also metadata. *
    To offer reference corrected data for entries without assignment or structure information
    (future release). Reference: [1] E.L. Ulrich, H. Akutsu, J.F. Doreleijers, Y. Harano,
