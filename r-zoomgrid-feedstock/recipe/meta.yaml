  summary: Provides the grid search algorithm with a zoom. The grid search algorithm with a zoom
    aims to help solving difficult optimization problem where there are many local optima
    inside the domain of the target function. It offers suitable initial or starting
    value for the following optimization procedure, provided that the global optimum
    exists in the neighbourhood of the initial or starting value. The grid search algorithm
    with a zoom saves time tremendously in cases with high-dimensional arguments.
