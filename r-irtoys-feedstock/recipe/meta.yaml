  summary: A collection of functions useful in learning and practicing IRT, which can be combined
    into larger programs. Provides basic CTT analysis, a simple common interface to
    the estimation of item parameters in IRT models for binary responses with three
    different programs (ICL, BILOG-MG, and ltm), ability estimation (MLE, BME, EAP,
    WLE, plausible values), item and person fit statistics, scaling methods (MM, MS,
    Stocking-Lord, and the complete Hebaera method), and a rich array of parametric
    and non-parametric (kernel) plots. Estimates and plots Haberman's interaction model
    when all items are dichotomously scored.
