  summary: Estimate influence networks from longitudinal bipartite relational data, where the
    longitudinal relations are continuous. The outputs are estimates of weighted influence
    networks among each actor type in the data set. The generative model is the Bipartite
    Longitudinal Influence Network (BLIN) model, a linear autoregressive model for these
    type of data. The supporting paper is ``Inferring Influence Networks from Longitudinal
    Bipartite Relational Data'', which is in preparation by the same authors. The model
    may be estimated using maximum likelihood methods and Bayesian methods. For more
    detail on methods, see Marrs et. al. <arXiv:1809.03439>.
