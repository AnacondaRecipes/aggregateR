  summary: An implementation of the data processing and data analysis portion of a pipeline named
    the PepSAVI-MS which is currently under development by the Hicks laboratory at the
    University of North Carolina.  The statistical analysis package presented herein
    provides a collection of software tools used to facilitate the prioritization of
    putative bioactive peptides from a complex biological matrix.  Tools are provided
    to deconvolute mass spectrometry features into a single representation for each
    peptide charge state, filter compounds to include only those possibly contributing
    to the observed bioactivity, and prioritize these remaining compounds for those
    most likely contributing to each bioactivity data set.
