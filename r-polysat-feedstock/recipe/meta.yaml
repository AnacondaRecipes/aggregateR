  summary: A collection of tools to handle microsatellite data of any ploidy (and samples of
    mixed ploidy) where allele copy number is not known in partially heterozygous genotypes.  It
    can import and export data in ABI 'GeneMapper', 'Structure', 'ATetra', 'Tetrasat'/'Tetra',
    'GenoDive', 'SPAGeDi', 'POPDIST', 'STRand', and binary presence/absence formats.  It
    can calculate pairwise distances between individuals using a stepwise mutation model
    or infinite alleles model, with or without taking ploidies and allele frequencies
    into account.  These distances can be used for the calculation of clonal diversity
    statistics or used for further analysis in R.  Allelic diversity statistics and
    Polymorphic Information Content are also available.  polysat can assist the user
    in estimating the ploidy of samples, and it can estimate allele frequencies in populations,
    calculate pairwise or global differentiation statistics based on those frequencies,
    and export allele frequencies to 'SPAGeDi' and 'adegenet'. Functions are also included
    for assigning alleles to isoloci in cases where one pair of microsatellite primers
    amplifies alleles from two or more independently segregating isoloci.  polysat is
    described by Clark and Jasieniuk (2011) <doi:10.1111/j.1755-0998.2011.02985.x> and
    Clark and Schreier (2017) <doi:10.1111/1755-0998.12639>.
