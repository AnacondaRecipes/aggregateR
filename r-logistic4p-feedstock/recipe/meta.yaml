  summary: Error in a binary dependent variable, also known as misclassification, has not drawn
    much attention in psychology. Ignoring misclassification in logistic regression
    can result in misleading parameter estimates and statistical inference. This package
    conducts logistic regression analysis with misspecification in outcome variables.
