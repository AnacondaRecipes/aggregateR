  summary: In a scatterplot where the response variable is Gaussian, Poisson or binomial, we
    consider the case in which the mean function is smooth with a change-point, which
    is a mode, an inflection point or a jump point. The main routine estimates the mean
    curve and the change-point as well using shape-restricted B-splines. An optional
    subroutine delivering a bootstrap confidence interval for the change-point is incorporated
    in the main routine.
