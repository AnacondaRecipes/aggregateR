  summary: This collection of data exploration tools was developed at Yale University for the
    graphical exploration of complex multivariate data; barcode and gpairs now have
    their own packages.  The big.read.table() function provided here may be useful for
    large files when only a subset is needed (but please see the note in the help page
    for this function).
