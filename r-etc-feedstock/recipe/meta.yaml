  summary: The package allows selecting those treatments of a one-way layout being equivalent
    to a control. Bonferroni adjusted "two one-sided t-tests" (TOST) and related simultaneous
    confidence intervals are given for both differences or ratios of means of normally
    distributed data. For the case of equal variances and balanced sample sizes for
    the treatment groups, the single-step procedure of Bofinger and Bofinger (1995)
    can be chosen. For non-normal data, the Wilcoxon test is applied.
