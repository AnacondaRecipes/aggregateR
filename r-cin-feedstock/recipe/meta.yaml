  summary: Many experiments in neuroscience involve randomized and fast stimulation while the
    continuous outcome measures respond at much slower time scale, for example event-related
    fMRI.  This package provide valid statistical tools with causal interpretation under
    these challenging settings, without imposing model assumptions.
