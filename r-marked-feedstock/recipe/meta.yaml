  summary: Functions for fitting various models to capture-recapture data including mixed-effects
    Cormack-Jolly-Seber(CJS) and multistate models and the multi-variate state model
    structure for survival estimation and POPAN structured Jolly-Seber models for abundance
    estimation. There are also Hidden Markov model (HMM) implementations of CJS and
    multistate models with and without state uncertainty and a simulation capability
    for HMM models.
