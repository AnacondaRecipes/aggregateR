  summary: Geographical detectors for measuring spatial stratified heterogeneity, as described
    in Jinfeng Wang (2010) <doi:10.1080/13658810802443457> and Jinfeng Wang (2016) <doi:10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.02.052>.
    Includes the optimal discretization of continuous data, four primary functions of
    geographical detectors, comparison of size effects of spatial unit and the visualizations
    of results. To use the package and to refer the descriptions of the package, methods
    and case datasets, please cite Yongze Song (2020) <doi:10.1080/15481603.2020.1760434>.
    The model has been applied in factor exploration of road performance and multi-scale
    spatial segmentation for network data, as described in Yongze Song (2018) <doi:10.3390/rs10111696>
    and Yongze Song (2020) <doi:10.1109/TITS.2020.3001193>, respectively.
