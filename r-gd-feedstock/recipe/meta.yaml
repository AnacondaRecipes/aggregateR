  summary: Geographical detectors for measuring spatial stratified heterogeneity, as described
    in Jinfeng Wang (2010) <doi:10.1080/13658810802443457> and  Jinfeng Wang (2016)
    <doi:10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.02.052>. Includes the optimal discretization of continuous
    data, four primary functions of  geographical detectors, comparison of size effects
    of spatial unit and  the visualizations of results. The descriptions of the package,
    methods and case datasets refer to the citation information below.
