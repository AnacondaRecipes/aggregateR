  summary: We propose to determine the correction of the significance level after multiple coding
    of an explanatory variable in Generalized Linear Model. The different methods of
    correction of the p-value are the Single step Bonferroni procedure, and resampling
    based methods developed by P.H.Westfall in 1993. Resampling methods are based on
    the permutation and the parametric bootstrap procedure. If some continuous, and
    dichotomous transformations are performed this package offers an exact correction
    of the p-value developed by B.Liquet & D.Commenges in 2005. The naive method with
    no correction is also available.
