  summary: 'Obtain parameters of Svensson''s Method, including percentage agreement,  systematic
    change and individual change. Also, the contingency table can be generated.  Svensson''s
    Method is a rank-invariant nonparametric method for the analysis of ordered scales  which
    measures the level of change both from systematic and individual aspects. For the
