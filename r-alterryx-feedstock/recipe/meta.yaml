  summary: A tool to access each of the 'Alteryx' Gallery 'API' endpoints. Users can queue jobs,
    poll job status, and retrieve application output as a data frame. You will need
    an 'Alteryx' Server license and have 'Alteryx' Gallery running to utilize this package.
    The 'API' is accessed through the 'URL' that you setup for the server running 'Alteryx'
    Gallery and more information on the endpoints can be found at <https://gallery.alteryx.com/api-docs/>.
