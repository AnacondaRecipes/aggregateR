  summary: Generates random numbers corresponding to the events on a Poisson point process with
    changing event rates. This includes the possibility to incorporate additional information
    such as the number of events occurring or the location of an already known event.
    It can also generate the probability density functions of specific events in the
    cases where additional information is available. Based on Hohmann (2019) <arXiv:1901.10754>.
