  summary: Miscellaneous convenience functions and wrapper functions to convert frequencies between
    Hz, semitones, mel and Bark, to create a matrix of dummy columns from a factor,
    to determine whether x lies in range [a,b], and to add a bracketed line to an existing
    plot. This package also contains an example data set of a stratified sample of 80
    talkers of Dutch.
