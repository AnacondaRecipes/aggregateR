  summary: Functions to deal with binary classification problems in the presence of imbalanced
    classes. Synthetic balanced samples are generated according to ROSE (Menardi and
    Torelli, 2013). Functions that implement more traditional remedies to the class
    imbalance are also provided, as well as different metrics to evaluate a learner
    accuracy. These are estimated by holdout, bootstrap or cross-validation methods.
