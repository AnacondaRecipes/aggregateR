  summary: 'Tools for large, sparse optimal matching of treated units and control units in observational
    studies.  Provisions are made for refined covariate balance constraints, which include
    fine and near-fine balance as special cases.  Matches are  optimal in the sense
    that they are computed as solutions to network optimization problems rather than
    greedy algorithms. '

# Description: Tools for large, sparse optimal matching of treated units and control units in observational studies.  Provisions are made for refined covariate balance constraints, which include fine and near-fine balance as special cases.  Matches are  optimal in the sense that they are computed as solutions to network optimization problems rather than greedy algorithms.
