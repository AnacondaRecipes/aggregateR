  summary: Tools for large, sparse optimal matching of treated units and control units in observational
    studies.  Provisions are made for refined covariate balance constraints, which include
    fine and near-fine balance as special cases.  Matches are optimal in the sense that
    they are computed as solutions to network optimization problems rather than greedy
    algorithms. See Pimentel, et al.(2015) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2014.997879> and Pimentel
    (2016), Obs. Studies 2(1):4-23. The rrelaxiv package, which provides an alternative
    solver for the underlying network flow problems, carries an academic license and
    is not available on CRAN, but may be downloaded from Github at <https://github.com/josherrickson/rrelaxiv/>.
