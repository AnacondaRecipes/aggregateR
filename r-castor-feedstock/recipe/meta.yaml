  summary: 'Efficient phylogenetic analyses on massive phylogenies comprising up to millions
    of tips. Functions include pruning, rerooting, calculation of most-recent common
    ancestors, calculating distances from the tree root and calculating pairwise distances.
    Calculation of phylogenetic signal and mean trait depth (trait conservatism), ancestral
    state reconstruction and hidden character prediction of discrete characters, simulating
    and fitting models of trait evolution, fitting and simulating diversification models,
    dating trees, comparing trees, and reading/writing trees in Newick format. Citation:
