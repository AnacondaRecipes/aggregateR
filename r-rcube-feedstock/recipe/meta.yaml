  summary: Provides simplified methods for managing classic Rubik's cubes and many other modifications
    of it (such as NxNxN size cubes, void cubes and 8-coloured cubes - so called octa
    cubes). Includes functions of handling special syntax for managing such cubes; and
    different approach to plotting 3D cubes without using external libraries (for example
    'OpenGL').
