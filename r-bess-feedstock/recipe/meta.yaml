  summary: An implementation of best subset selection in generalized linear model and Cox proportional
    hazard model via the primal dual active set algorithm proposed by Wen, C., Zhang,
    A., Quan, S. and Wang, X. (2017) <arXiv:1709.06254>. The algorithm formulates coefficient
    parameters and residuals as primal and dual variables and utilizes efficient active
    set selection strategies based on the complementarity of the primal and dual variables.
