  summary: An implementation of best subset selection in generalized linear model and Cox proportional
    hazard model via the primal dual active set algorithm proposed by Wen, C., Zhang,
    A., Quan, S. and Wang, X. (2020) <doi:10.18637/jss.v094.i04>. The algorithm formulates
    coefficient parameters and residuals as primal and dual variables and utilizes efficient
    active set selection strategies based on the complementarity of the primal and dual
    variables.
