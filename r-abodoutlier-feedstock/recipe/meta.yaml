  summary: Performs angle-based outlier detection on a given dataframe. Three methods are available,
    a full but slow implementation using all the data that has cubic complexity, a fully
    randomized one which is way more efficient and another using k-nearest neighbours.
    These algorithms are specially well suited for high dimensional data outlier detection.
