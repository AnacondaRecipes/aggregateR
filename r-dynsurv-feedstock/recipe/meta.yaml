  summary: Time-varying coefficient models for interval censored and right censored survival
    data including 1) Bayesian Cox model with time-independent, time-varying or dynamic
    coefficients for right censored and interval censored data studied by Sinha et al.
    (1999) <doi:10.1111/j.0006-341X.1999.00585.x> and Wang et al. (2013) <doi:10.1007/s10985-013-9246-8>,
    2) Spline based time-varying coefficient Cox model for right censored data proposed
    by Perperoglou et al. (2006) <doi:10.1016/j.cmpb.2005.11.006>, and 3) Transformation
    model with time-varying coefficients for right censored data using estimating equations
    proposed by Peng and Huang (2007) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asm058>.
