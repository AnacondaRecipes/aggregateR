  summary: Rapidly create a GUI interface for a function you created by automatically creating
    widgets for arguments of the function. Automatically parses help routines for context-sensitive
    help to these arguments. The interface essentially a wrapper to some Tcl/Tk routines
    to both simplify and facilitate GUI creation. More advanced Tcl/Tk routines/GUI
    objects can be incorporated into the interface for greater customization for the
    more experienced.
