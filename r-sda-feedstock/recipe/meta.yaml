  summary: Provides an efficient framework for high-dimensional linear and diagonal discriminant
    analysis with variable selection.  The classifier is trained using James-Stein-type
    shrinkage estimators and predictor variables are ranked using correlation-adjusted
    t-scores (CAT scores).  Variable selection error is controlled using false non-discovery
    rates or higher criticism.
