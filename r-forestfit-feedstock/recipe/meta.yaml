  summary: 'Developed for the following tasks. I) Computing the probability density function,
    cumulative distribution function, random generation, and estimating the parameters
    of the eleven mixture models including mixture of Birnbaum-Saunders, BurrXII, Chen,
    F, Frechet, gamma, Gompertz, log-logistic, log-normal, Lomax, and Weibull. II) Point
    estimation of the parameters of two- and three-parameter Weibull distributions.
    In the case of two-parameter, twelve methods consist of generalized least square
    type 1, generalized least square type 2, L-moment, maximum likelihood, logarithmic
    moment, moment, percentile, rank correlation, least square, weighted maximum likelihood,
    U-statistic, weighted least square are used and investigated methods for the three-parameter
    case are: maximum likelihood, modified moment type 1, modified moment type 2, modified
    moment type 3, modified maximum likelihood type 1, modified maximum likelihood type
    2, modified maximum likelihood type 3, modified maximum likelihood type 4, moment,
    maximum product spacing, T-L moment, and weighted maximum likelihood. III) The Bayesian
    estimators of the three-parameter Weibull distribution. IV) Estimating parameters
    of the three-parameter Weibull distribution fitted to grouped data using three methods
    including approximated maximum likelihood, expectation maximization, and maximum
    likelihood. V) Estimating the parameters of the gamma, log-normal, and Weibull mixture
    models fitted to the grouped data through the EM algorithm. VI) Estimating parameters
    of the non-linear growth curve fitted to the height-diameter observations.'
