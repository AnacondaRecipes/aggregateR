  summary: Developed for the following tasks. 1 ) Computing the probability density function,
    cumulative distribution function, random generation, and estimating the parameters
    of the eleven mixture models. 2 ) Point estimation of the parameters of two - parameter
    Weibull distribution using twelve methods and three - parameter Weibull distribution
    using nine methods. 3 ) The Bayesian inference for the three - parameter Weibull
    distribution. 4 ) Estimating parameters of the three - parameter Birnbaum - Saunders,
    generalized exponential, and Weibull distributions fitted to grouped data using
    three methods including approximated maximum likelihood, expectation maximization,
    and maximum likelihood. 5 ) Estimating the parameters of the gamma, log-normal,
    and Weibull mixture models fitted to the grouped data through the EM algorithm,
    6 ) Estimating parameters of the nonlinear height curve fitted to the height - diameter
    observation, 7 ) Estimating parameters, computing probability density function,
    cumulative distribution function, and generating realizations from gamma shape mixture
    model introduced by Venturini et al. (2008) <doi:10.1214/07-AOAS156> , 8 ) The Bayesian
    inference, computing probability density function, cumulative distribution function,
    and generating realizations from four-parameter Johnson SB distribution, 9 ) Robust
    multiple linear regression analysis when error term follows skewed t distribution,
    10 ) Estimating parameters of a given distribution fitted to grouped data using
    method of maximum likelihood, and 11 ) Estimating parameters of the Johnson SB distribution
    through the Bayesian, method of moment, conditional maximum likelihood, and two
    - percentile method.
