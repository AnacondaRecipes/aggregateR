  summary: "Implementation of the tests for rotational symmetry on the hypersphere proposed in
    Garc\xEDa-Portugu\xE9s, Paindaveine and Verdebout (2019) <arXiv:1706.05030>. The
    package also implements the proposed distributions on the hypersphere, based on
    the tangent-normal decomposition, and allows for the replication of the data application
    considered in the paper."
