  summary: "Implementation of the tests for rotational symmetry on the hypersphere proposed in
    Garc\xEDa-Portugu\xE9s, Paindaveine and Verdebout (2020) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2019.1665527>.
    The package also implements the proposed distributions on the hypersphere, based
    on the tangent-normal decomposition, and allows for the replication of the data
    application considered in the paper."
