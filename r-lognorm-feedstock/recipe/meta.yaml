  summary: The lognormal distribution (Limpert et al. (2001) <doi:10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051%5B0341:lndats%5D2.0.co;2>)
    can characterize uncertainty that is bounded by zero. This package provides estimation
    of distribution parameters, computation of moments and other basic statistics, and
    an approximation of the distribution of the sum of several correlated lognormally
    distributed variables (Lo 2013 <doi:10.12988/ams.2013.39511>) and the approximation
    of the difference of two correlated lognormally distributed variables (Lo 2012 <doi:10.1155/2012/838397>).
