  summary: Provides tools for computing Monte Carlo standard errors (MCSE) in Markov chain Monte
    Carlo (MCMC) settings. MCSE computation for expectation and quantile estimators
    is supported as well as multivariate estimations. The package also provides functions
    for computing effective sample size and for plotting Monte Carlo estimates versus
    sample size.
