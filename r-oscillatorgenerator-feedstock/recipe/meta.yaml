  summary: The supplied code allows for the generation of discrete time series of oscillating
    species. General shapes can be selected by means of individual functions, which
    are widely customizable by means of function arguments. All code was developed in
    the Biological Information Processing Group at the BioQuant Center at Heidelberg
    University, Germany.
