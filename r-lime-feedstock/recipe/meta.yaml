  summary: When building complex models, it is often difficult to explain why the model should
    be trusted. While global measures such as accuracy are useful, they cannot be used
    for explaining why a model made a specific prediction. 'lime' (a port of the 'lime'
    'Python' package) is a method for explaining the outcome of black box models by
    fitting a local model around the point in question an perturbations of this point.
    The approach is described in more detail in the article by Ribeiro et al. (2016)
    <arXiv:1602.04938>.
