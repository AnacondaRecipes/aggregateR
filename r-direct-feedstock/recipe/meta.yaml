  summary: A Bayesian clustering method for replicated time series or replicated measurements
    from multiple experimental conditions, e.g., time-course gene expression data.  It
    estimates the number of clusters directly from the data using a Dirichlet-process
    prior.  See Fu, A. Q., Russell, S., Bray, S. and Tavare, S. (2013) Bayesian clustering
    of replicated time-course gene expression data with weak signals. The Annals of
    Applied Statistics. 7(3) 1334-1361. <doi:10.1214/13-AOAS650>.
