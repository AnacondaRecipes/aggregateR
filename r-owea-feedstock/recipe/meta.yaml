  summary: An implementation of optimal weight exchange algorithm Yang(2013) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2013.806268>
    for three models. They are Crossover model with subject dropout, crossover model
    with proportional first order residual effects and interference model. You can use
    it to find either A-opt or D-opt approximate designs. Exact designs can be automatically
    rounded from approximate designs and relative efficiency is provided as well.
