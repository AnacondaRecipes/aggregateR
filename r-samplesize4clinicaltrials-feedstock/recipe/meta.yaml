  summary: There are four categories of Phase III clinical trials according to different research
    goals, including (1) Testing for equality, (2) Superiority trial, (3) Non-inferiority
    trial, and (4) Equivalence trial. This package aims to help researchers to calculate
    sample size when comparing means or proportions in Phase III clinical trials with
    different research goals.
