  summary: 'The design of phase 3 clinical trials can be classified into 4 types: (1) Testing
    for equality;(2) Superiority trial;(3) Non-inferiority trial; and (4) Equivalence
    trial according to the goals. Given that none of the available packages combines
    these designs in a single package, this package has made it possible for researchers
    to calculate sample size when comparing means or proportions in phase 3 clinical
    trials with different designs. The ssc function can calculate the sample size with
    pre-specified type 1 error rate,statistical power and effect size according to the
    hypothesis testing framework. Furthermore, effect size is comprised of true treatment
    difference and non-inferiority or equivalence margins which can be set in ssc function.
