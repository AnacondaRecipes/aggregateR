  summary: Determine the sample size requirement to achieve the target probability of correct
    classification (PCC) for studies employing high-dimensional features.  The package
    implements functions to 1) determine the asymptotic feasibility of the classification
    problem; 2) compute the upper bounds of the PCC for any linear classifier; 3) estimate
    the PCC of three design methods given design assumptions; 4) determine the sample
    size requirement to achieve the target PCC for three design methods.
