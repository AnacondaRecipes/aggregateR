  summary: A machine learning package for automatic text classification that makes it simple
    for novice users to get started with machine learning, while allowing experienced
    users to easily experiment with different settings and algorithm combinations. The
    package includes eight algorithms for ensemble classification (svm, slda, boosting,
    bagging, random forests, glmnet, decision trees, neural networks), comprehensive
    analytics, and thorough documentation.
