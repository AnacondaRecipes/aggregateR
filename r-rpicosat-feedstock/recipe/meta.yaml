  summary: Bindings for the 'PicoSAT' solver to solve Boolean satisfiability problems (SAT).
    The boolean satisfiability problem asks the question if a given boolean formula
    can be TRUE; i.e. does there exist an assignment of TRUE/FALSE for each variable
    such that the whole formula is TRUE? The package bundles 'PicoSAT' solver release
    965 <http://www.fmv.jku.at/picosat/>.
