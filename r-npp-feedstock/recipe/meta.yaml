  summary: Posterior sampling in several commonly used distributions using normalized power prior
    as described in Duan, Ye and Smith (2006) <doi:10.1002/env.752> and Ibrahim et.al.
    (2015) <doi:10.1002/sim.6728>. Sampling of the power parameter is achieved via either
    independence Metropolis-Hastings or random walk Metropolis-Hastings based on transformation.
