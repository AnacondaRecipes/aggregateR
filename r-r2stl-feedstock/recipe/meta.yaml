  summary: r2stl, R package for visualizing data using a 3D printer Package r2stl converts R
    data to STL (stereolithography) files that can be used to feed a 3-dimensional printer.  The
    3-dimensional output from an R function can be materialized into a solid surface
    in a plastic material, therefore allowing more detailed examination. There are many
    possible uses for this new R tool, such as to examine mathematical expressions with
    very irregular shapes, to aid teaching people with impaired vision, to create raised
    relief maps from digital elevation maps (DEMs), to bridge the gap between mathematical
    tools and rapid prototyping, and many more.  Ian Walker created the function "r2stl"
    and Jose' Gama assembled the package.
