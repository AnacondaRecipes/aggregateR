  summary: This package contains several functions for calculating the most widely used effect
    sizes (ES), along with their variances, confidence intervals and p-values.  The
    output includes ES's of d (mean difference), g (unbiased estimate of d), r (correlation
    coefficient), z' (Fisher's z), and OR (odds ratio and log odds ratio). In addition,
    NNT (number needed to treat), U3, CLES (Common Language Effect Size) and Cliff's
    Delta are computed. This package uses recommended formulas as described in The Handbook
    of Research Synthesis and Meta-Analysis (Cooper, Hedges, & Valentine, 2009).
