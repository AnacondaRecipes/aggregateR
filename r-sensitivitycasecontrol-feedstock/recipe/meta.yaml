  summary: 'This package performs sensitivity analysis for case-control studies in which some
    cases may meet a more narrow definition of being a case compared to other cases
    which only meet a broad definition.  The sensitivity analyses are described in Small,
    Cheng, Halloran and Rosenbaum (2013, "Case Definition and Sensitivity Analysis",
    Journal of the American Statistical Association, 1457-1468).  The functions sens.analysis.mh
    and sens.analysis.aberrant.rank provide sensitivity analyses based on the Mantel-Haenszel
    test statistic and aberrant rank test statistic as described in Rosenbaum (1991,
    "Sensitivity Analysis for Matched Case Control Studies", Biometrics); see also Section
    1 of Small et al.  The function adaptive.case.test provides adaptive inferences
    as described in Section 5 of Small et al.  The function adaptive.noether.brown provides
    a sensitivity analysis for a matched cohort study based on an adaptive test.  The
    other functions in the package are internal functions.  '
