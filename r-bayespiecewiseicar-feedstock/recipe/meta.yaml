  summary: Fits a piecewise exponential hazard to survival data using a Hierarchical Bayesian
    model with an Intrinsic Conditional Autoregressive formulation for the spatial dependency
    in the hazard rates for each piece. This function uses Metropolis- Hastings-Green
    MCMC to allow the number of split points to vary. This function outputs graphics
    that display the histogram of the number of split points and the trace plots of
    the hierarchical parameters. The function outputs a list that contains the posterior
    samples for the number of split points, the location of the split points, and the
    log hazard rates corresponding to these splits. Additionally, this outputs the posterior
    samples of the two hierarchical parameters, Mu and Sigma^2.
