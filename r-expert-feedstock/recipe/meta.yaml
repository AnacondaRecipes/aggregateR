  summary: Expert opinion (or judgment) is a body of techniques to estimate the distribution
    of a random variable when data is scarce or unavailable. Opinions on the quantiles
    of the distribution are sought from experts in the field and aggregated into a final
    estimate. The package supports aggregation by means of the Cooke, Mendel-Sheridan
    and predefined weights models.
