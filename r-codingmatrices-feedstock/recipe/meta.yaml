  summary: A collection of coding functions as alternatives to the standard functions in the
    stats package, which have names starting with 'contr.'.  Their main advantage is
    that they provide a consistent method for defining marginal effects in factorial
    models.  In a simple one-way ANOVA model the intercept term is always the simple
    average of the class means.
