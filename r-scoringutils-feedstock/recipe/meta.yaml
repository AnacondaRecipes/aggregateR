  summary: "Provides a collection of metrics and proper scoring rules (Tilmann Gneiting & Adrian
    E Raftery (2007) <doi:10.1198/016214506000001437>, Jordan, A., Kr\xFCger, F., &
    Lerch, S. (2019) <doi:10.18637/jss.v090.i12>) within a consistent framework for
    evaluation, comparison and visualisation of forecasts. In addition to proper scoring
    rules, functions are provided to assess bias, sharpness and calibration (Sebastian
    Funk, Anton Camacho, Adam J. Kucharski, Rachel Lowe, Rosalind M. Eggo, W. John Edmunds
    (2019) <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006785>) of forecasts. Several types of predictions
    (e.g. binary, discrete, continuous) which may come in different formats (e.g. forecasts
    represented by predictive samples or by quantiles of the predictive distribution)
    can be evaluated. Scoring metrics can be used either through a convenient data.frame
    format, or can be applied as individual functions in a vector / matrix format. All
    functionality has been implemented with a focus on performance and is robustly tested."
