  summary: Using frequency matrices, very low frequency variants (VLFs) are assessed for amino
    acid and nucleotide sequences.  The VLFs are then compared to see if they occur
    in only one member of a species, singleton VLFs, or if they occur in multiple members
    of a species, shared VLFs.  The amino acid and nucleotide VLFs are then compared
    to see if they are concordant with one another.  Amino acid VLFs are also assessed
    to determine if they lead to a change in amino acid residue type, and potential
    changes to protein structures.
