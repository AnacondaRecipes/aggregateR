  summary: Contains techniques for mining large and high-dimensional data sets by using the concept
    of Intrinsic Dimension (ID). Here the ID is not necessarily an integer. It is extended
    to fractal dimensions. And the Morisita estimator is used for the ID estimation,
    but other tools are included as well.
