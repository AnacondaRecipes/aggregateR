  summary: Optogenetics is a new tool to study neuronal circuits that have been genetically modified
    to allow stimulation by flashes of light.  This package implements the methodological
    framework, Point-process Response model for Optogenetics (PRO), for analyzing data
    from these experiments.  This method provides explicit nonlinear transformations
    to link the flash point-process with the spiking point-process.  Such response functions
    can be used to provide important and interpretable scientific insights into the
    properties of the biophysical process that governs neural spiking in response to
    optogenetic stimulation.
