  summary: Provides a collection of tools for detecting influential cases in generalized mixed
    effects models. It analyses models that were estimated using 'lme4'. The basic rationale
    behind identifying influential data is that when single units are omitted from the
    data, models based on these data should not produce substantially different estimates.
    To standardize the assessment of how influential a (single group of) observation(s)
    is, several measures of influence are common practice, such as Cook's Distance.  In
    addition, we provide a measure of percentage change of the fixed point  estimates
    and a simple procedure to detect changing levels of significance.
