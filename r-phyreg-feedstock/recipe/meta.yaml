  summary: Provides general linear model facilities (single y-variable, multiple x-variables
    with arbitrary mixture of continuous and categorical and arbitrary interactions)
    for cross-species data. The method is, however, based on the nowadays rather uncommon
    situation in which uncertainty about a phylogeny is well represented by adopting
    a single polytomous tree. The theory is in A. Grafen (1989, Proc. R. Soc. B 326,
    119-157) and aims to cope with both recognised phylogeny (closely related species
    tend to be similar) and unrecognised phylogeny (a polytomy usually indicates ignorance
    about the true  sequence of binary splits).
