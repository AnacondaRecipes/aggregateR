  summary: Node harvest is a simple interpretable tree-like estimator for high-dimensional regression
    and classification. A few nodes are selected from an initially large ensemble of
    nodes, each associated with a positive weight. New observations can fall into one
    or several nodes and predictions are the weighted average response across all these
    groups. The package offers visualization of the estimator. Predictions can return
    the nodes a new observation fell into, along with the mean response of training
    observations in each node, offering a simple explanation of the prediction.
