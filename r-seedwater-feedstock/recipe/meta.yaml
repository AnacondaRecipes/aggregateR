  summary: 'Bringing together tools for modeling drying and soaking (rehydration) kinetics of
    seeds. This package contains several widely used predictive models (e.g.: da Silva
    et al., 2018). As these are nonlinear, the functions are interactive-based  and
    easy-to-use. Least squares estimates are obtained with just a few visual adjustments  of
    the initial parameter values.  Reference: da Silva AR et al. (2018) <doi:10.2134/agronj2017.07.0373>.'
