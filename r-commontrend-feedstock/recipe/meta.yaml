  summary: 'Directly extract and plot stochastic common trends from a cointegration system using
    different approaches, currently including Kasa (1992) and Gonzalo and Granger (1995).  The
    approach proposed by Gonzalo and Granger, also known as Permanent-Transitory Decomposition,
    is widely used in macroeconomics and market microstructure literature.  Kasa''s
    approach, on the other hand, has a nice property that it only uses the super consistent
    estimator: the cointegration vector ''beta''.  This package also provides functions
    calculate P-value from Johansen Statistics according to the approximation method
    proposed by Doornik (1998). Update: 0.7-1: Fix bugs in calculation alpha. Add formulas
    and more explanations. 0.6-1: Rewrite the description file. 0.5-1: Add functions
    to calculate P-value from Johansen statistic, and vice versa.'
