  summary: Functions to test/check/verify/investigate the ordering of vectors. The 'is_[strictly_]*'
    family of functions test vectors for 'sorted', 'monotonic', 'increasing', 'decreasing'
    order; 'is_constant' and 'is_incremental' test for the degree of ordering. `ordering`
    provides a numeric indication of ordering -2 (strictly decreasing) to 2 (strictly
    increasing).
