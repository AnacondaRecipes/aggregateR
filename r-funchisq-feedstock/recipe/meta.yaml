  summary: Statistical hypothesis testing methods for inferring model-free functional dependency
    using asymptotic chi-squared or exact distributions. Functional test statistics
    are asymmetric and functionally optimal, unique from other related statistics. Tests
    in this package reveal evidence for causality based on the causality-by- functionality
    principle. They include asymptotic functional chi-squared tests (Zhang & Song 2013)
    <arXiv:1311.2707>, an adapted functional chi-squared test, and an exact functional
    test (Zhong & Song 2019) <doi:10.1109/TCBB.2018.2809743> (Nguyen et al. 2020) <doi:10.24963/ijcai.2020/372>.
    The normalized functional chi-squared test was used by Best Performer 'NMSUSongLab'
    in HPN-DREAM (DREAM8) Breast Cancer Network Inference Challenges (Hill et al. 2016)
    <doi:10.1038/nmeth.3773>. A function index (Zhong & Song 2019) <doi:10.1186/s12920-019-0565-9>
    (Kumar et al. 2018) <doi:10.1109/BIBM.2018.8621502> derived from the functional
    test statistic offers a new effect size measure for the strength of functional dependency,
    a better alternative to conditional entropy in many aspects. For continuous data,
    these tests offer an advantage over regression analysis when a parametric functional
    form cannot be assumed; for categorical data, they provide a novel means to assess
    directional dependency not possible with symmetrical Pearson's chi-squared or Fisher's
    exact tests.
