  summary: 'Bayesian estimation and prediction for stochastic processes based on the Euler approximation.
    Considered processes are: jump diffusion, (mixed) diffusion models, hidden (mixed)
    diffusion models, non-homogeneous Poisson processes (NHPP), (mixed) regression models
    for comparison and a regression model including a NHPP.'
