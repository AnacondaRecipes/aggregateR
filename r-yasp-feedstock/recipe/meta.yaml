  summary: 'A collection of string functions designed for writing  compact and expressive R code.
    ''yasp'' (Yet Another String Package) is simple, fast, dependency-free, and written
    in pure R. The package provides: a coherent set of abbreviations for paste() from
    package ''base'' with a variety of defaults, such as p() for "paste" and pcc() for
    "paste and collapse with commas"; wrap(), bracket(), and others for wrapping a string
    in flanking characters; unwrap() for removing pairs of characters (at any position
    in a string); and sentence() for cleaning whitespace around punctuation and capitalization
    appropriate for prose sentences.'
