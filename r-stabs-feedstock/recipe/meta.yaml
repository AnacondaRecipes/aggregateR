  summary: Resampling procedures to assess the stability of selected variables with additional
    finite sample error control for high-dimensional variable selection procedures such
    as Lasso or boosting. Both, standard stability selection (Meinshausen & Buhlmann,
    2010, <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2010.00740.x>)  and complementary pairs stability
    selection with improved error bounds  (Shah & Samworth, 2013, <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2011.01034.x>)
    are implemented. The package can be combined with arbitrary user specified variable
    selection approaches.
