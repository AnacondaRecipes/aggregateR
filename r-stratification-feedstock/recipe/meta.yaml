  summary: 'Univariate stratification of survey populations with a generalization of the  Lavallee-Hidiroglou
    method of stratum construction. The generalized method takes into account  a discrepancy
    between the stratification variable and the survey variable. The determination  of
    the optimal boundaries also incorporate, if desired, an anticipated non-response,
    a take-all  stratum for large units, a take-none stratum for small units, and a
    certainty stratum to ensure  that some specific units are in the sample. The well
    known cumulative root frequency rule of  Dalenius and Hodges and the geometric rule
    of Gunning and Horgan are also implemented. '
