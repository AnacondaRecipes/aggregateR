  summary: Enrich your 'ggplots' with group-wise comparisons. This package provides an easy way
    to indicate if two groups are significantly different. Commonly this is shown by
    a bracket on top connecting the groups of interest which itself is annotated with
    the level of significance (NS, *, **, ***).  The package provides a single layer
    (geom_signif()) that takes the groups for comparison and the test (t.test(), wilcox.text()
    etc.) as arguments and adds the annotation to the plot.
