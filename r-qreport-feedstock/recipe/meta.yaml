  summary: Provides statistical components, tables, and graphs that are useful in 'Quarto' and
    'RMarkdown' reports and that produce 'Quarto' elements for special formatting such
    as tabs and marginal notes and graphs. Some of the functions produce entire report
    sections with tabs, e.g., the missing data report created by missChk().  Functions
    for inserting variables and tables inside 'graphviz' and 'mermaid' diagrams are
    included, and so are special clinical trial graphics for adverse event reporting.
