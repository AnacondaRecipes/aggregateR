  summary: 'Stochastic Newton Sampler (SNS) is a Metropolis-Hastings-based, Markov Chain Monte
    Carlo sampler for twice differentiable, log-concave probability density functions
    (PDFs) where the proposal density function is a multivariate Gaussian resulting
    from a second-order Taylor-series expansion of log-density around the current point.
    The mean of the Gaussian proposal is the full Newton-Raphson step from the current
    point. A Boolean flag allows for switching from SNS to Newton-Raphson optimization
    (by choosing the mean of proposal function as next point). This can be used during
    burn-in to get close to the mode of the PDF (which is unique due to concavity).
    For high-dimensional densities, mixing can be improved via ''state space partitioning''
    strategy, in which SNS is applied to disjoint subsets of state space, wrapped in
    a Gibbs cycle. Numerical differentiation is available when analytical expressions
    for gradient and Hessian are not available. Facilities for validation and numerical
    differentiation of log-density are provided. Note: Formerly available versions of
    the MfUSampler can be obtained from the archive <https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/MfUSampler/>.'
