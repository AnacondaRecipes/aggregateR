  summary: In mathematics, 'rejection sampling' is a basic technique used to generate observations
    from a distribution. It is also commonly called 'the Acceptance-Rejection method'
    or 'Accept-Reject algorithm' and is a type of Monte Carlo method. 'Acceptance-Rejection
    method' is based on the observation that to sample a random variable one can perform
    a uniformly random sampling of the 2D cartesian graph, and keep the samples in the
    region under the graph of its density function. Package 'AR' is able to generate/simulate
    random data from a probability density function by Acceptance-Rejection method.
    Moreover, this package is a useful teaching resource for graphical presentation
    of Acceptance-Rejection method. From the practical point of view, the user needs
    to calculate a constant in Acceptance-Rejection method, which package 'AR' is able
    to compute this constant by optimization tools. Several numerical examples are provided
    to illustrate the graphical presentation for the Acceptance-Rejection Method.
