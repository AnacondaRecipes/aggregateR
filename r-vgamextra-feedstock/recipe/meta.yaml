  summary: Extending the functionalities of the 'VGAM' package with additional functions and
    datasets. At present, 'VGAMextra' comprises new family functions (ffs) to estimate
    several time series models by maximum likelihood using Fisher scoring,  unlike popular
    packages in CRAN relying on optim(), including ARMA-GARCH-like models, the Order-(p,
    d, q) ARIMAX model (non- seasonal), the Order-(p) VAR model, error correction models
    for cointegrated time series, and ARMA-structures with Student-t  errors. For independent
    data, new ffs to estimate the inverse- Weibull, the inverse-gamma, the generalized
    beta of the second kind and the general multivariate normal distributions are available.
    In addition, 'VGAMextra' incorporates new VGLM-links for the mean-function, and
    the quantile-function (as an alternative to ordinary quantile modelling) of several
    1-parameter distributions, that are compatible with the class of VGLM/VGAM family
    functions. Currently, only fixed-effects models are implemented. All functions are
    subject to change; see the NEWS for further details on the latest changes.
