  summary: Feature hashing, also called as the hashing trick, is a method to transform features
    of a instance to a vector. Thus, it is a method to transform a real dataset to a
    matrix. Without looking up the indices in an associative array, it applies a hash
    function to the features and uses their hash values as indices directly. The method
    of feature hashing in this package was proposed in Weinberger et al. (2009) <arXiv:0902.2206>.
    The hashing algorithm is the murmurhash3 from the 'digest' package. Please see the
    README in <https://github.com/wush978/FeatureHashing> for more information.
