  summary: 'Tools for constructing a matched design with multiple comparison groups. Further
    specifications of refined covariate balance restriction and exact match on  covariate
    can be imposed. Matches are approximately optimal in  the sense that the  cost of
    the solution is at most twice the optimal cost, Crama and Spieksma (1992)  <doi:10.1016/0377-2217(92)90078-N>. '
