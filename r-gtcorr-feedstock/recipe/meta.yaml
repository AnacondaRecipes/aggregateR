  summary: This package provides functions to calculate the efficiencies (expected tests per
    unit) of hierarchical and matrix group testing procedures.  Efficiencies can be
    calculated in the presense of correlated responses under multiple arrangements of
    clustesrs.  Efficiencies can also be evaluated in the presense of test error.
