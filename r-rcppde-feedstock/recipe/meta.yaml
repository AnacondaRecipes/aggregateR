  summary: 'An efficient C++ based implementation of the ''DEoptim'' function which performs
    global optimization by differential evolution. Its creation was motivated by trying
    to see if the old approximation "easier, shorter, faster: pick any two" could in
    fact be extended to achieving all three goals while moving the code from plain old
    C to modern C++.  The initial version did in fact do so, but a good part of the
    gain was due to an implicit code review which eliminated a few inefficiencies which
    have since been eliminated in ''DEoptim''.'
