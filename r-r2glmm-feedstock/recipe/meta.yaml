  summary: The model R squared and semi-partial R squared for the linear and generalized linear
    mixed model (LMM and GLMM) are computed with confidence limits. The R squared measure
    from Edwards et.al (2008) <DOI:10.1002/sim.3429> is extended to the GLMM using penalized
    quasi-likelihood (PQL) estimation (see Jaeger et al. 2016 <DOI:10.1080/02664763.2016.1193725>).
    Three methods of computation are provided and described as follows. First, The Kenward-Roger
    approach. Due to some inconsistency between the 'pbkrtest' package and the 'glmmPQL'
    function, the Kenward-Roger approach in the 'r2glmm' package is limited to the LMM.
    Second, The method introduced by Nakagawa and Schielzeth (2013) <DOI:10.1111/j.2041-210x.2012.00261.x>
    and later extended by Johnson (2014) <DOI:10.1111/2041-210X.12225>. The 'r2glmm'
    package only computes marginal R squared for the LMM and does not generalize the
    statistic to the GLMM; however, confidence limits and semi-partial R squared for
    fixed effects are useful additions. Lastly, an approach using standardized generalized
    variance (SGV) can be used for covariance model selection. Package installation
    instructions can be found in the readme file.
