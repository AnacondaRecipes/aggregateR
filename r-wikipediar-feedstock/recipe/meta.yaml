  summary: 'Provides an interface to the Wikipedia web application programming interface (API),
    using internet connexion.Three functions provide details for a specific Wikipedia
    page : all links that are present, all pages that link to, all the contributions
    (revisions for main pages, and discussions for talk pages). Two functions provide
    details for a specific user : all contributions, and general information (as name,
    gender, rights or groups). It provides additional information compared to others
    packages, as WikipediR. It does not need login. The multiplex network that can be
    constructed from the results of the functions of WikipediaR can be modeled as Stochastic
    Block Model as in Barbillon P., Donnet, S., Lazega E., and Bar-Hen A. : Stochastic
    Block Models for Multiplex networks: an application to networks of researchers,
    ArXiv 1501.06444, http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06444.'
