  summary: General-purpose MCMC and SMC samplers, as well as plot and diagnostic functions for
    Bayesian statistics, with a particular focus on calibrating complex system models.
    Implemented samplers include various Metropolis MCMC variants (including adaptive
    and/or delayed rejection MH), the T-walk, two differential evolution MCMCs, two
    DREAM MCMCs, and a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) particle filter.
