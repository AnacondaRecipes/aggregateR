  summary: '''The Proton Game'' is a console-based data-crunching game for younger and older
    data scientists. Act as a data-hacker and find Slawomir Pietraszko''s credentials
    to the Proton server. You have to solve four data-based puzzles to find the login
    and password. There are many ways to solve these puzzles. You may use loops, data
    filtering, ordering, aggregation or other tools. Only basics knowledge of R is required
    to play the game, yet the more functions you know, the more approaches you can try.
    The knowledge of dplyr is not required but may be very helpful. This game is linked
    with the ,,Pietraszko''s Cave'''' story available at http://biecek.pl/BetaBit/Warsaw.
    It''s a part of Beta and Bit series. You will find more about the Beta and Bit series
