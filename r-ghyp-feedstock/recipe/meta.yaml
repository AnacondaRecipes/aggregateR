  summary: Detailed functionality for working with the univariate and multivariate Generalized
    Hyperbolic distribution and its special cases (Hyperbolic (hyp), Normal Inverse
    Gaussian (NIG), Variance Gamma (VG), skewed Student-t and Gaussian distribution).
    Especially, it contains fitting procedures, an AIC-based model selection routine,
    and functions for the computation of density, quantile, probability, random variates,
    expected shortfall and some portfolio optimization and plotting routines as well
    as the likelihood ratio test. In addition, it contains the Generalized Inverse Gaussian
    distribution.
