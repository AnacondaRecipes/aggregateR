  summary: 'Implements anomaly detection as binary classification for cross-sectional data. Uses
    maximum likelihood estimates and normal probability functions to classify observations
    as anomalous. The method is presented in the following lecture from the Machine
    Learning course by Andrew Ng: <https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/C8IJp/algorithm/>,
