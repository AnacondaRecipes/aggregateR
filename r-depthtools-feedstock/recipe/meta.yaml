  summary: depthTools is a package that implements different statistical tools for the description
    and analysis of gene expression data based on the concept of data depth, namely,
    the scale curves for visualizing the dispersion of one or various groups of samples
    (e.g. types of tumors), a rank test to decide whether two groups of samples come
    from a single distribution and two methods of supervised classification techniques,
    the DS and TAD methods. All these techniques are based on the Modified Band Depth,
    which is a recent notion of depth with a low computational cost, what renders it
    very appropriate for high dimensional data such as gene expression data.
