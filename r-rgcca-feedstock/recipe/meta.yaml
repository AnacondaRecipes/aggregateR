  summary: 'Multi-block data analysis concerns the analysis of several sets of variables (blocks)
    observed on the same group of individuals. The main aims of the RGCCA package are:
    to study the relationships between blocks and to identify subsets of variables of
    each block which are active in their relationships with the other blocks. This package
    allows to (i) run R/SGCCA and related methods, (ii) help the user to find out the
    optimal parameters for R/SGCCA such as regularization parameters (tau or sparsity),
    (iii) evaluate the stability of the RGCCA results and their significance, (iv) build
    predictive models from the R/SGCCA. (v) Generic print() and plot() functions apply
    to all these functionalities.'
