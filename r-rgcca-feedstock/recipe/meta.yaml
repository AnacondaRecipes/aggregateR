  summary: 'Multiblock data analysis concerns the analysis of several sets of variables (blocks)
    observed on the same group of individuals. The main aims of the RGCCA package are:
    (i) to study the relationships between blocks and (ii) to identify subsets of variables
    of each block which are active in their relationships with the other blocks.'
