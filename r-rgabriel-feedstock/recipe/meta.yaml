  summary: 'Analyze multi-level one-way experimental designs where there are unequal sample sizes
    and population variance homogeneity can not be assumed. To conduct the Gabriel test
    <doi:10.2307/2286265>, create two vectors: one for your observations and one for
    the factor level of each observation. The function, rgabriel, conduct the test and
    save the output as a vector to input into the gabriel.plot function, which produces
    a confidence interval plot for Multiple Comparison.'
