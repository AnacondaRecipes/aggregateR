  summary: 'This package was created to analyze multi-level one-way experimental designs. It
    is designed to handle vectorized observation and factor data where there are unequal
    sample sizes and population variance homogeneity can not be assumed. To conduct
    the Gabriel test, create two vectors: one for your  observations and one for the
    factor level of each observation.  The function, rgabriel, conduct the test and
    save the output as a vector to input into the gabriel.plot function, which produces  a
    confidence interval plot for Multiple Comparison.'
