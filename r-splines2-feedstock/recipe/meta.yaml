  summary: Constructs basis matrix of B-splines, M-splines, I-splines, convex splines (C-splines),
    periodic M-splines, natural cubic splines, generalized Bernstein polynomials, and
    their integrals (except C-splines) and derivatives of given order by close-form
    recursive formulas. It also contains a C++ head-only library integrated with Rcpp.
