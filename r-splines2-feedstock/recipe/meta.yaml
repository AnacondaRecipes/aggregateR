  summary: Constructs basis functions of B-splines, M-splines, I-splines, convex splines (C-splines),
    periodic splines, natural cubic splines, generalized Bernstein polynomials, their
    derivatives, and integrals (except C-splines) by closed-form recursive formulas.
    It also contains a C++ head-only library integrated with Rcpp. See Wang and Yan
    (2021) <doi:10.6339/21-JDS1020> for details.
