  summary: Functions for nonlinear regression parameters estimation by algorithms based on Controlled
    Random Search algorithm. Both functions (crs4hc(), crs4hce()) adapt current search
    strategy by four heuristics competition. In addition, crs4hce() improves adaptability
    by adaptive stopping condition.
