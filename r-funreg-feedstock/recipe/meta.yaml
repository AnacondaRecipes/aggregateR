  summary: Performs functional regression, and some related approaches, for intensive longitudinal
    data (see the book by Walls & Schafer, 2006, Models for Intensive Longitudinal Data,
    Oxford) when such data is not necessarily observed on an equally spaced grid of
    times.  The approach generally follows the ideas of Goldsmith, Bobb, Crainiceanu,
    Caffo, and Reich (2011)<DOI:10.1198/jcgs.2010.10007> and the approach taken in their
    sample code, but with some modifications to make it more feasible to use with long
    rather than wide, non-rectangular longitudinal datasets with unequal and potentially
    random measurement times.  It also allows easy plotting of the correlation between
    the smoothed covariate and the outcome as a function of time, which can add additional
    insights on how to interpret a functional regression.  Additionally, it also provides
    several permutation tests for the significance of the functional predictor.  The
    heuristic interpretation of ``time'' is used to describe the index of the functional
    predictor, but the same methods can equally be used for another unidimensional continuous
    index, such as space along a north-south axis.  Note that most of the functionality
    of this package has been superseded by added features after 2016 in the 'pfr' function
    by Jonathan Gellar, Mathew W. McLean, Jeff Goldsmith, and Fabian Scheipl, in the
    'refund' package built by Jeff Goldsmith and co-authors and maintained by Julia
    Wrobel. The development of the funreg package in 2015 and 2016 was part of a research
    project supported by Award R03 CA171809-01 from the National Cancer Institute and
    Award P50 DA010075 from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The content is solely
