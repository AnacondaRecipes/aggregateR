  summary: Performs functional regression, and some related approaches, for intensive longitudinal
    data (see the book by Walls & Schafer,  2006, Models for Intensive Longitudinal
    Data, Oxford) when such data is not necessarily observed on an equally spaced grid
    of times.  The approach generally follows the ideas of Goldsmith, Bobb, Crainiceanu,
    Caffo, and Reich (2011)<DOI:10.1198/jcgs.2010.10007> and the approach taken in their
    sample code, but with some modifications to make it more feasible to use with long
    rather than wide, non-rectangular longitudinal datasets with unequal and potentially
    random measurement times.  It also allows easy plotting of the correlation between
    the smoothed covariate and the outcome as a function of time, which can add additional
    insights on how to interpret a functional regression.  Additionally, it also provides
    several permutation tests for the significance of the functional predictor.  The
    heuristic interpretation of ``time'' is used to describe the index of the functional
    predictor, but the same methods can equally be used for another unidimensional continuous
    index, such as space along a north-south axis.  The development of this package
    was part of a research project supported by Award R03 CA171809-01 from the National
    Cancer Institute and Award P50 DA010075 from the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
