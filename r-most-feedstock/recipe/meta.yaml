  summary: Provides functions similar to the 'SAS' macros previously provided to accompany Collins,
    Dziak, and Li (2009) <DOI:10.1037/a0015826> and Dziak, Nahum-Shani, and Collins
    (2012) <DOI:10.1037/a0026972>, papers which outline practical benefits and challenges
    of factorial and fractional factorial experiments for scientists interested in developing
    biological and/or behavioral interventions, especially in the context of the multiphase
    optimization strategy (see Collins, Kugler & Gwadz 2016) <DOI:10.1007/s10461-015-1145-4>.  The
    package currently contains three functions. First, RelativeCosts1() draws a graph
    of the relative cost of complete and reduced factorial designs versus other alternatives.
    Second, RandomAssignmentGenerator() returns a dataframe which contains a list of
    random numbers that can be used to conveniently assign participants to conditions
    in an experiment with many conditions. Third, FactorialPowerPlan() estimates the
    power, detectable effect size, or required sample size of a factorial or fractional
    factorial experiment, for main effects or interactions, given several possible choices
    of effect size metric, and allowing pretests and clustering.
