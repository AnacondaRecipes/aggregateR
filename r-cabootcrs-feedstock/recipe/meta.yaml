  summary: Performs simple correspondence analysis on a two-way contingency table, or multiple
    correspondence analysis (homogeneity analysis) on data with p categorical variables,
    and produces bootstrap-based elliptical confidence regions around the projected
    coordinates for the category points. Includes routines to plot the results in a
    variety of styles. Also reports the standard numerical output for correspondence
    analysis.
