  summary: Code execution timing functions 'tic' and 'toc' that can be nested. One can record
    all timings while a complex script is running, and examine the values later. It
    is also possible to instrument the timing calls with custom callbacks. In addition,
    this package provides class 'Stack', implemented as a vector, and class 'StackList',
    which is a stack implemented as a list, both of which support operations 'push',
    'pop', 'first_element', 'last_element' and 'clear'.
