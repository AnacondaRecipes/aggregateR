  summary: This package provides the timing functions 'tic' and 'toc' that can be nested. One
    can record all timings while a complex script is running, and examine the values
    later. It is also possible to instrument the timing calls with custom callbacks.
    In addition, this package provides class 'Stack', implemented as a vector, and class
    'List', implemented as a list, both of which support operations 'push', 'pop', 'first',
    'last' and 'clear'.
