  summary: 'Gives access to data visualisation methods that are relevant from the data scientist''s
    point of view. The flagship idea of ''DataVisualizations'' is the mirrored density
    plot (MD-plot) for either classified or non-classified multivariate data published
    in Thrun, M.C. et al.: "Analyzing the Fine Structure of Distributions" (2020), PLoS
    ONE, <DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0238835>. The MD-plot outperforms the box-and-whisker
    diagram (box plot), violin plot and bean plot and geom_violin plot of ggplot2. Furthermore,
    a collection of various visualization methods for univariate data is provided. In
    the case of exploratory data analysis, ''DataVisualizations'' makes it possible
    to inspect the distribution of each feature of a dataset visually through a combination
    of four methods. One of these methods is the Pareto density estimation (PDE) of
    the probability density function (pdf). Additionally, visualizations of the distribution
    of distances using PDE, the scatter-density plot using PDE for two variables as
    well as the Shepard density plot and the Bland-Altman plot are presented here. Pertaining
    to classified high-dimensional data, a number of visualizations are described, such
    as f.ex. the heat map and silhouette plot. A political map of the world or Germany
    can be visualized with the additional information defined by a classification of
    countries or regions. By extending the political map further, an uncomplicated function
    for a Choropleth map can be used which is useful for measurements across a geographic
    area. For categorical features, the Pie charts, slope charts and fan plots, improved
    by the ABC analysis, become usable. More detailed explanations are found in the
    book by Thrun, M.C.: "Projection-Based Clustering through Self-Organization and
    Swarm Intelligence" (2018) <DOI:10.1007/978-3-658-20540-9>.'
