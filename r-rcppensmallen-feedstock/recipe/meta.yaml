  summary: '''Ensmallen'' is a templated C++ mathematical optimization library  (by the ''MLPACK''
    team) that provides a simple set of abstractions for writing an objective function
    to optimize. Provided within are various standard and cutting-edge optimizers that
    include full-batch gradient descent techniques,  small-batch techniques, gradient-free
    optimizers, and constrained optimization. The ''RcppEnsmallen'' package includes
    the header files from the ''Ensmallen'' library and pairs the appropriate header
    files from ''armadillo'' through the  ''RcppArmadillo'' package. Therefore, users
    do not need to install ''Ensmallen'' nor ''Armadillo'' to use ''RcppEnsmallen''.
    Note that ''Ensmallen'' is licensed under  3-Clause BSD, ''Armadillo'' starting
    from 7.800.0 is licensed under Apache License 2, ''RcppArmadillo'' (the ''Rcpp''
    bindings/bridge to ''Armadillo'') is licensed under  the GNU GPL version 2 or later.
    Thus, ''RcppEnsmallen'' is also licensed under similar terms. Note that ''Ensmallen''
    requires a compiler that supports  ''C++11'' and ''Armadillo'' 8.400 or later.'
