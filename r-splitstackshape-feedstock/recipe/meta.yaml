  summary: Online data collection tools like Google Forms often export multiple-response questions
    with data concatenated in cells. The concat.split (cSplit) family of functions splits
    such data into separate  cells. The package also includes functions to stack groups
    of columns and  to reshape wide data, even when the data are "unbalanced"---something  which
    reshape (from base R) does not handle, and which melt and dcast from  reshape2 do
    not easily handle.
