  summary: 'A plot overlying the niche of multiple species is obtained: 1) to determine the niche
    conditions which favor a higher species richness, 2) to create a box plot with the
    range of environmental variables of the species, 3) to obtain a list of species
    in an area of the niche selected by the user and, 4) to estimate niche overlap among
    the species.'
