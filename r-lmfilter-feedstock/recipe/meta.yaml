  summary: 'We present a method based on filtering algorithms to estimate the parameters of linear
    regressions, i.e. the coefficients and the variance of the error term. The proposed
    algorithms make use of Particle Filters following Ristic, B., Arulampalam, S., Gordon,
    N. (2004, ISBN: 158053631X) resampling methods.'
