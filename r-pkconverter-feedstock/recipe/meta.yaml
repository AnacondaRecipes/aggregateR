  summary: 'Pharmacokinetics is the study of drug absorption, distribution,  metabolism, and
    excretion. The pharmacokinetics model explains that how the  drug concentration
    change as the drug moves through the different compartments of the body. For pharmacokinetic
    modeling and analysis, it is essential to understand the basic pharmacokinetic parameters.
    All parameters are  considered, but only some of parameters are used in the model.
    Therefore,  we need to convert the estimated parameters to the other parameters
    after  fitting the specific pharmacokinetic model. This package is developed to
    help this converting work. For more detailed explanation of pharmacokinetic  parameters,
