  summary: 'Pharmacokinetics is the study of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion.
    The pharmacokinetics model explains that how the drug concentration change as the
    drug moves through the different compartments of the body. For pharmacokinetic modeling
    and analysis, it is essential to understand the basic pharmacokinetic parameters.
    All parameters are considered, but only some of parameters are used in the model.
    Therefore, we need to convert the estimated parameters to the other parameters after
    fitting the specific pharmacokinetic model. This package is developed to help this
    converting work. For more detailed explanation of pharmacokinetic parameters, see
