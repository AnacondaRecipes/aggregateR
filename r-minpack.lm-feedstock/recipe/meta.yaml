  summary: The nls.lm function provides an R interface to lmder and lmdif from the MINPACK library,
    for solving nonlinear least-squares problems by a modification of the Levenberg-Marquardt
    algorithm, with support for lower and upper parameter bounds.  The implementation
    can be used via nls-like calls using the nlsLM function.
