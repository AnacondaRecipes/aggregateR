  summary: 'Package computes and displays tables with support for ''SPSS''-style  labels, multiple
    and nested banners, weights, multiple-response variables  and significance testing.
    There are facilities for nice output of tables  in ''knitr'', ''Shiny'', ''*.xlsx''
    files, R and ''Jupyter'' notebooks. Methods  for labelled variables add value labels
    support to base R functions and to  some functions from other packages. Additionally,
    the package brings  popular data transformation functions from ''SPSS'' Statistics
    and ''Excel'':  ''RECODE'', ''COUNT'', ''COMPUTE'', ''DO IF'', ''COUNTIF'', ''VLOOKUP''
    and etc.  These functions are very useful for data processing in marketing research  surveys.
    Package intended to help people to move data  processing from ''Excel'' and ''SPSS''
    to R.'
