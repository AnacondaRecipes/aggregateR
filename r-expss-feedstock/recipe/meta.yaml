  summary: 'Package computes and displays tables with support for ''SPSS''-style labels, multiple
    and nested banners, weights, multiple-response variables and significance testing.
    There are facilities for nice output of tables in ''knitr'', ''Shiny'', ''*.xlsx''
    files, R and ''Jupyter'' notebooks. Methods for labelled variables add value labels
    support to base R functions and to some functions from other packages. Additionally,
    the package brings popular data transformation functions from ''SPSS'' Statistics
    and ''Excel'': ''RECODE'', ''COUNT'', ''COUNTIF'', ''VLOOKUP'' and etc. These functions
    are very useful for data processing in marketing research surveys. Package intended
    to help people to move data processing from ''Excel'' and ''SPSS'' to R.'
