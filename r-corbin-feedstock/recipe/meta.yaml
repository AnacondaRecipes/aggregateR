  summary: We design algorithms with linear time complexity with respect to the dimension for
    three commonly studied correlation structures, including exchangeable, decaying-product
    and K-dependent correlation structures, and extend the algorithms to generate binary
    data of general non-negative correlation matrices with quadratic time complexity.

    of the method.
