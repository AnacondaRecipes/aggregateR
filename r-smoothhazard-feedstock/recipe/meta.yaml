  summary: Estimation of two-state (survival) models and irreversible illness- death models with
    possibly interval-censored,left-truncated and right-censored data. Proportional
    intensities regression models can be specified to allow for covariates effects separately
    for each transition. We use either a parametric approach with Weibull baseline intensities
    or a semi-parametric approach with M-splines approximation of baseline intensities
    in order to obtain smooth estimates of the hazard functions. Parameter estimates
    are obtained by maximum likelihood in the parametric approach and by penalized maximum
    likelihood in the semi-parametric approach.
