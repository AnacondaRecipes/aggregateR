  summary: Implements variable selection procedures for low to moderate size generalized linear
    regressions models. It includes the STOPES functions for linear regression (Capanu
    M, Giurcanu M, Begg C, Gonen M, Optimized variable selection via repeated data splitting,
    Statistics in Medicine, 2020, 19(6):2167-2184) as well as subsampling based optimization
    methods for generalized linear regression models (Marinela Capanu, Mihai Giurcanu,
    Colin B Begg, Mithat Gonen, Subsampling based variable selection for generalized
    linear models).
