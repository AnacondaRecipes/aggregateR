  summary: 'This is an R implementation of a constrained l1 minimization approach for estimating
    multiple Sparse Gaussian or Nonparanormal Graphical Models (SIMULE). The SIMULE
    algorithm can be used to estimate multiple related precision matrices. For instance,
    it can identify context-specific gene networks from multi-context gene expression
    datasets. By performing data-driven network inference from high-dimensional and
    heterogenous data sets, this tool can help users effectively translate aggregated
    data into knowledge that take the form of graphs among entities. Please run demo(simuleDemo)
    to learn the basic functions provided by this package. For further details, please
    read the original paper: Beilun Wang, Ritambhara Singh, Yanjun Qi (2017) <DOI:10.1007/s10994-017-5635-7>.'
