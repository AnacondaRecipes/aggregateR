  summary: The analysis of environmental data often requires the detection of trends and change-points.
    This package includes tests for trend detection (Cox-Stuart Trend Test, Mann-Kendall
    Trend Test, (correlated) Hirsch-Slack Test, partial Mann-Kendall Trend Test, multivariate
    (multisite) Mann-Kendall Trend Test, (Seasonal) Sen's slope, partial Pearson and
    Spearman correlation trend test), change-point detection (Lanzante's test procedures,
    Pettitt's test, Buishand Range Test, Buishand U Test, Standard Normal Homogeinity
    Test), detection of non-randomness (Wallis-Moore Phase Frequency Test, Bartels rank
    von Neumann's ratio test, Wald-Wolfowitz Test) and the two sample Robust Rank-Order
    Distributional Test.
