  summary: An implementation of Multi-Task Logistic Regression (MTLR) for R.  This package is
    based on the method proposed by Yu et al. (2011) which utilized MTLR for generating
    individual survival curves by learning feature weights which vary across time. This
    model was further extended to account for left and interval censored data.
