  license: MIT
  summary: Provides a suite of function-building tools centered around a (forward) composition
    operator, %>>>%, which extends the semantics of the 'magrittr' %>% operator and
    supports 'Tidyverse' quasiquotation. It enables you to construct composite functions
    that can be inspected and transformed as list-like objects. In conjunction with
    %>>>%, a compact function constructor, fn(), and a partial-application constructor,
    partial(), are also provided; both support quasiquotation.
