  summary: Compute energy fluxes in trophic networks, from resources to their consumers, and
    can be applied to systems ranging from simple two-species interactions to highly
    complex food webs. It implements the approach described in Gauzens et al. (2017)
    <doi:10.1101/229450> to calculate energy fluxes, which are also used to calculate
    equilibrium stability.
