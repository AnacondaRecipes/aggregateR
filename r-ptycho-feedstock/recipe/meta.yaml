  summary: ' Bayesian variable selection for linear regression models using hierarchical priors.
    There is a prior that combines information across responses and one that combines
    information across covariates, as well as a standard spike and slab prior for comparison.
    An MCMC samples from the marginal posterior distribution for the 0-1 variables indicating
    if each covariate belongs to the model for each response.'
