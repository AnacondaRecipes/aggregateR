  summary: The function 'missForest' in this package is used to impute missing values particularly
    in the case of mixed-type data. It uses a random forest trained on the observed
    values of a data matrix to predict the missing values. It can be used to impute
    continuous and/or categorical data including complex interactions and non-linear
    relations. It yields an out-of-bag (OOB) imputation error estimate without the need
    of a test set or elaborate cross-validation. It can be run in parallel to save computation
    time.
