  summary: This package fits Cox proportional hazards models containing both  fixed and random
    effects.  The random effects can have a general form, of which familial interactions
    (a "kinship" matrix) is a particular special case.  Note that the simplest case
    of a mixed effects Cox model, i.e. a single random  per-group intercept, is also
    called a "frailty" model.  The approach is based on Rippatti and Palgren, Biometrics
    2002.
