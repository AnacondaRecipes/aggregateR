  summary: Fit Cox proportional hazards models containing both fixed and random effects.  The
    random effects can have a general form, of which familial interactions (a "kinship"
    matrix) is a particular special case. Note that the simplest case of a mixed effects
    Cox model, i.e. a single random per-group intercept, is also called a "frailty"
    model.  The approach is based on Ripatti and Palmgren, Biometrics 2002.
