  summary: Efficient implementation of Kernel SHAP, see Lundberg and Lee (2017), and Covert and
    Lee (2021) <http://proceedings.mlr.press/v130/covert21a>. For models with up to
    eight features, the results are exact regarding the selected background data.  Otherwise,
    an almost exact hybrid algorithm involving iterative sampling is used.  The package
    plays well together with meta-learning packages like 'tidymodels', 'caret' or 'mlr3'.
    Visualizations can be done using the R package 'shapviz'.
