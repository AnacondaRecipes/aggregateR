  summary: Offers a generalization of the scatterplot matrix based on the recognition that most
    datasets include both categorical and quantitative information. Traditional grids
    of scatterplots often obscure important features of the data when one or more variables
    are categorical but coded as numerical. The generalized pairs plot offers a range
    of displays of paired combinations of categorical and quantitative variables. Emerson
