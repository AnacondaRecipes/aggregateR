  summary: A one-function package containing 'prediction()', a type-safe alternative to 'predict()'
    that always returns a data frame. The 'summary()' method provides a data frame with
    average predictions, possibly over counterfactual versions of the data (a la the
    'margins' command in 'Stata'). Marginal effect estimation is provided by the related
    package, 'margins' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=margins>. The package currently
    supports common model types (e.g., "lm", "glm") from the 'stats' package, as well
    as numerous other model classes from other add-on packages. See the README or main
    package documentation page for a complete listing.
