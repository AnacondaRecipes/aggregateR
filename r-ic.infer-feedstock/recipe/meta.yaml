  summary: Implements inequality constrained inference. This includes parameter estimation in
    normal (linear) models under linear equality and inequality constraints, as well
    as normal likelihood ratio tests involving inequality-constrained hypotheses. For
    inequality-constrained linear models, averaging over R-squared for different orderings
    of regressors is also included.
