  summary: 'Implements the Bayesian and likelihood methods proposed  in Imai, Lu, and Strauss
    (2008 <DOI: 10.1093/pan/mpm017>) and  (2011 <DOI:10.18637/jss.v042.i05>) for ecological
    inference in 2  by 2 tables as well as the method of bounds introduced by Duncan
    and  Davis (1953).  The package fits both parametric and nonparametric  models using
    either the Expectation-Maximization algorithms (for  likelihood models) or the Markov
    chain Monte Carlo algorithms (for  Bayesian models).  For all models, the individual-level
    data can be  directly incorporated into the estimation whenever such data are available.
    Along with in-sample and out-of-sample predictions, the package also provides a
    functionality which allows one to quantify the effect of data aggregation on parameter
    estimation and hypothesis testing under the parametric likelihood models.'
