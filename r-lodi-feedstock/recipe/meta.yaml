  summary: Impute observed values below the limit of detection (LOD) via censored likelihood
    multiple imputation (CLMI) in single-pollutant models, developed by Boss et al (2019)
    <doi:10.1097/EDE.0000000000001052>. CLMI handles exposure detection limits that
    may change throughout the course of exposure assessment. 'lodi' provides functions
    for imputing and pooling for this method.
