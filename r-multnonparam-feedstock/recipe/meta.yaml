  summary: A collection of multivariate nonparametric methods, selected in part to support an
    MS level course in nonparametric statistical methods. Methods include adjustments
    for multiple comparisons, implementation of multivariate Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon testing,
    inversion of these tests to produce a confidence region, some permutation tests
    for linear models, and some algorithms for calculating exact probabilities associated
    with one- and two- stage testing involving Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon statistics.  Supported
    by grant NSF DMS 1712839.  See Kolassa and Seifu (2013) <doi:10.1016/j.acra.2013.03.006>.
