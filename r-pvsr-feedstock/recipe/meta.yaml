# Note: In order to use this package you need your personal Project Vote Smart API key. To get an API-key you need to sign up for access to PVS' API (see http://votesmart.org/share/api for details). Whenever you are using pvsR make sure that your personal PVS API key is saved as a character string in the variable pvs.key (pvs.key <- "yourkey"). If there is no valid PVS API key saved in the variable pvs.key the functions in this package won't work.
