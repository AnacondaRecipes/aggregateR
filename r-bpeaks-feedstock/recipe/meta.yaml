  summary: 'bPeaks is a simple approach to identify transcription factor binding sites from ChIP-seq
    data. Our general philosophy is to provide an easy-to-use tool, well-adapted for
    small eukaryotic genomes (< 20 Mb). bPeaks uses a combination of 4 cutoffs (T1,
    T2, T3 and T4) to mimic "good peak" properties as described by biologists who visually
    inspect the ChIP-seq data on a genome browser. For yeast genomes, bPeaks calculates
    the proportion of peaks that fall in promoter sequences. These peaks are good candidates
    as transcription factor binding sites. '
