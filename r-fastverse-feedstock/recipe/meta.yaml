  summary: 'Easy installation, loading and management, of high-performance packages for statistical
    computing and data manipulation in R. The core ''fastverse'' consists of 4 packages:
    ''data.table'', ''collapse'', ''kit'' and ''magrittr'', that jointly only depend
    on ''Rcpp''. The ''fastverse'' can be freely and permanently extended with additional
    packages, both globally or for individual projects. Separate package verses can
    also be created. Fast packages for many common tasks such as time series, dates
    and times, strings, spatial data, statistics, data serialization, larger-than-memory
    processing, and compilation of R code are listed in the README file: <https://github.com/fastverse/fastverse#suggested-extensions>.'
