  summary: It identifies the factors significantly related to species richness, and their relative
    contribution, using multiple regressions and support vector machine models. It uses
    an output file of 'ModestR' (<http://www.ipez.es/ModestR>) with data of richness
    of the species and environmental variables in a cell size defined by the user. The
    residuals of the support vector machine model are shown on a map. Negative residuals
    may be potential areas with undiscovered and/or unregistered species, or areas with
    decreased species richness due to the negative effect of anthropogenic factors.
