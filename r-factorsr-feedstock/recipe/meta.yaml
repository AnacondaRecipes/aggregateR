  summary: It identifies the factors significantly related to species richness, and their relative
    contribution, using multiple regressions and support vector machine models. It uses
    an output file of 'ModestR' with data of richness of the species and environmental
    variables in a cell size defined by the user. The residuals of the support vector
    machine model are shown on a map. Negative residuals may be potential areas with
    undiscovered and/or unregistered species, or areas with decreased species richness
    due to the negative effect of anthropogenic factors.
