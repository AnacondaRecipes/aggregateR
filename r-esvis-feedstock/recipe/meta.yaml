  summary: 'A variety of methods are provided to estimate and visualize distributional differences
    in terms of effect sizes. Particular emphasis is upon evaluating differences between
    two or more distributions across the entire scale, rather than at a single point
    (e.g., differences in means). For example, Probability-Probability (PP) plots display
    the difference between two or more distributions, matched by their empirical CDFs
    (see Ho and Reardon, 2012; <doi:10.3102/1076998611411918>), allowing for examinations
    of where on the scale distributional differences are largest or smallest. The area
    under the PP curve (AUC) is an effect-size metric, corresponding to the probability
    that a randomly selected observation from the x-axis distribution will have a higher
    value than a randomly selected observation from the y-axis distribution. Binned
    effect size plots are also available, in which the distributions are split into
    bins (set by the user) and separate effect sizes (Cohen''s d) are produced for each
    bin - again providing a means to evaluate the consistency (or lack thereof) of the
    difference between two or more distributions at different points on the scale. Evaluation
    of empirical CDFs is also provided, with  built-in arguments for providing annotations
    to help evaluate distributional differences at specific points (e.g., semi-transparent
    shading). All function take a consistent argument structure. Calculation of specific
    effect sizes is also possible. The following effect sizes are estimable: (a) Cohen''s
    d, (b) Hedges'' g, (c) percentage above a cut, (d) transformed (normalized) percentage
    above a cut, (e)  area under the PP curve, and (f) the V statistic (see Ho, 2009;
    <doi:10.3102/1076998609332755>), which essentially transforms the area under the
    curve to standard deviation units. By default, effect sizes are calculated for all
    possible pairwise comparisons, but a reference group (distribution) can be specified.'

# Description: A variety of methods are provided to estimate and visualize distributional differences in terms of effect sizes. Particular emphasis is upon evaluating differences between two or more distributions across the entire scale, rather than at a single point (e.g., differences in means). For example, Probability-Probability (PP) plots display the difference between two or more distributions, matched by their empirical CDFs (see Ho and Reardon, 2012; <doi:10.3102/1076998611411918>), allowing for examinations of where on the scale distributional differences are largest or smallest.
