  summary: 'Routines to perform estimation and inference under the multivariate t-distribution.
    Currently, the following methodologies are implemented: multivariate mean and covariance
    estimation, hypothesis testing about the mean, equicorrelation and homogeneity of
    variances, the Wilson-Hilferty transformation, QQ-plots with envelopes and random
    variate generation. Some auxiliary functions are also provided.'
