  summary: 'Performs robust multiple testing for means in the presence of known and unknown latent
    factors presented in Fan et al.(2019) "FarmTest: Factor-Adjusted Robust Multiple
    Testing With Approximate False Discovery Control" <doi:10.1080/01621459.2018.1527700>.
    Implements a series of adaptive Huber methods combined with fast data-drive tuning
    schemes proposed in Ke et al.(2019) "User-Friendly Covariance Estimation for Heavy-Tailed
    Distributions" <doi:10.1214/19-STS711> to estimate model parameters and construct
    test statistics that are robust against heavy-tailed and/or asymmetric error distributions.
    Extensions to two-sample simultaneous mean comparison problems are also included.
    As by-products, this package contains functions that compute adaptive Huber mean,
    covariance and regression estimators that are of independent interest.'
