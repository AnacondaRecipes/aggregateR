  summary: Implementations for several robust procedures that allow for (online) extraction of
    the signal of univariate or multivariate time series by applying robust regression
    techniques to a moving time window are provided. Included are univariate filtering
    procedures based on repeated-median regression as well as hybrid and trimmed filters
    derived from it; see Schettlinger et al. (2006) <doi:10.1515/BMT.2006.010>. The
    adaptive online repeated median by Schettlinger et al. (2010) <doi:10.1002/acs.1105>
    and the slope comparing adaptive repeated median by Borowski and Fried (2013) <doi:10.1007/s11222-013-9391-7>
    choose the width of the moving time window adaptively. Multivariate versions are
    also provided; see Borowski et al. (2009) <doi:10.1080/03610910802514972> for a
    multivariate online adaptive repeated median and Borowski (2012) <doi:10.17877/DE290R-14393>
    for a multivariate slope comparing adaptive repeated median. Furthermore, a repeated-median
    based filter with automatic outlier replacement and shift detection is provided;
