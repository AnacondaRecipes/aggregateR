  summary: 'Additional matrix functionality for R including: (1) wrappers for the base matrix
    function that allow matrices to be created from character strings and lists (the
    former is especially useful for creating block matrices), (2) better printing of
    large matrices via the generic "pretty" print function, and (3) a number of convenience
    functions for users more familiar with other scientific languages like ''Julia'',
    ''Matlab''/''Octave'', or ''Python''+''NumPy''.'
