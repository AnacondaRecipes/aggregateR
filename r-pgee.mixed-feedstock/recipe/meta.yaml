  summary: Perform simultaneous estimation and variable selection for correlated bivariate mixed
    outcomes (one continuous outcome and one binary outcome per cluster) using penalized
    generalized estimating equations. In addition, clustered Gaussian and binary outcomes
    can also be modeled. The SCAD, MCP, and LASSO penalties are supported. Cross-validation
    can be performed to find the optimal regularization parameter(s).
