  summary: 'For surface energy models and estimation of solar positions and components with varying
    topography, time and locations. The functions calculate solar top-of-atmosphere,
    open, diffuse and direct components, atmospheric transmittance and diffuse factors,
    day length, sunrise and sunset, solar azimuth, zenith, altitude, incidence, and
    hour angles, earth declination angle, equation of time, and solar constant. Details
