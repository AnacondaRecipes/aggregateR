  summary: Write beautiful yet customizable letters in R Markdown and directly obtain the finished
    PDF. Smooth generation of PDFs is realized by 'rmarkdown', the 'pandoc-letter' template
    and the 'KOMA-Script' letter class. 'KOMA-Script' provides enhanced replacements
    for the standard 'LaTeX' classes with emphasis on typography and versatility. 'KOMA-Script'
    is particularly useful for international writers as it handles various paper formats
    well, provides layouts for many common window envelope types (e.g. German, US, French,
    Japanese) and lets you define your own layouts. The package comes with a default
    letter layout based on 'DIN 5008B'.
