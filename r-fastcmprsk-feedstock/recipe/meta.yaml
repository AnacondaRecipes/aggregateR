  summary: In competing risks regression, the proportional subdistribution hazards (PSH) model
    is popular for its direct assessment of covariate effects on the cumulative incidence
    function. This package allows for both penalized and unpenalized PSH regression
    in linear time using a novel forward-backward scan. Penalties include Ridge, Lease
    Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation
    (SCAD), Minimax Concave Plus (MCP), and elastic net.
