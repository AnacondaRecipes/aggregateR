  summary: Regularized (polychotomous) logistic regression by Gibbs sampling. The package implements
    subtly different MCMC schemes with varying efficiency depending on the data type
    (binary v. binomial, say) and the desired estimator (regularized maximum likelihood,
    or Bayesian maximum a posteriori/posterior mean, etc.) through a unified interface.
