  summary: Miscellaneous functions to help customise 'ggplot2' objects. High-level functions
    are provided to post-process 'ggplot2' layouts and allow alignment between plot
    panels, as well as setting panel sizes to fixed values. Other functions include
    a custom 'geom', and helper functions to enforce symmetric scales or add tags to
    facetted plots.
