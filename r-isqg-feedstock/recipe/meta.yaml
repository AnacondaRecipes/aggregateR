  summary: Accomplish high performance simulations in quantitative genetics. The molecular genetic
    components are represented by R6/C++ classes and methods. The core computational
    algorithm is implemented using bitsets according to <doi:10.1534/g3.119.400373>.
    A mix between low and high level interfaces provides great flexibility and allows
    user defined extensions and a wide range of applications.
