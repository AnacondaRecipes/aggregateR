  summary: Fast, flexible framework for implementing Bayesian optimization of model hyperparameters
    according to the methods described in Snoek et al. <arXiv:1206.2944>. The package
    allows the user to run scoring function in parallel, save intermediary results,
    and tweak other aspects of the process to fully utilize the computing resources
    available to the user.
