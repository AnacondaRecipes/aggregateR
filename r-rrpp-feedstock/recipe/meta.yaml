  summary: Linear model calculations are made for many random versions of data.   Using residual
    randomization in a permutation procedure, sums of squares are  calculated over many
    permutations to generate empirical probability distributions  for evaluating model
    effects.  This packaged is described by  Collyer & Adams (2018) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13029>.  Additionally,
    coefficients, statistics, fitted values, and residuals generated over many  permutations
    can be used for various procedures including pairwise tests, prediction, classification,
    and model comparison.  This package should provide most tools one could need for
    the analysis of high-dimensional data, especially in ecology and evolutionary biology,
    but certainly other fields, as well.
