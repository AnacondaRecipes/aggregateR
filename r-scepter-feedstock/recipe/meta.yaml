  summary: A pipeline for estimating the stellar age, mass, and radius given observational effective
    temperature, [Fe/H], and astroseismic parameters. The results are obtained adopting
    a maximum likelihood technique over a grid of pre-computed stellar models, as described
    in Valle et al. (2014) <doi:10.1051/0004-6361/201322210>.
