  summary: Contains an implementation of invariant causal prediction for sequential data. The
    main function in the package is 'seqICP', which performs linear sequential invariant
    causal prediction and has guaranteed type I error control. For non-linear dependencies
    the package also contains a non-linear method 'seqICPnl', which allows to input
    any regression procedure and performs tests based on a permutation approach that
    is only approximately correct. In order to test whether an individual set S is invariant
    the package contains the subroutines 'seqICP.s' and 'seqICPnl.s' corresponding to
    the respective main methods.
