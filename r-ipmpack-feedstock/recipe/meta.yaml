  summary: 'IPMpack takes demographic vital rates and (optionally) environmental data to build
    integral projection models.  A number of functional forms for growth and survival
    can be incorporated, as well as a range of reproductive strategies.  The package
    also includes a suite of diagnostic routines, provides classic matrix model output
    (e.g., lambda, elasticities, sensitivities), and produces post-hoc metrics (e.g.,
    passage time and life expectancy).  '
