  summary: A lightweight package that adds progress bar to vectorized R functions ('*apply').
    The implementation can easily be added to functions where showing the progress is
    useful (e.g. bootstrap). The type and style of the progress bar (with percentages
    or remaining time) can be set through options. Supports several parallel processing
    backends.
