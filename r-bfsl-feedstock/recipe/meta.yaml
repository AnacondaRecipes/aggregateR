  summary: "Provides the solution from York (1968) <doi:10.1016/S0012-821X(68)80059-7> for fitting
    a straight line to bivariate data with errors in both coordinates. It gives unbiased
    estimates of the intercept, slope and standard errors of the best-fit straight line
    to independent points with (possibly correlated)  normally distributed errors in
    both x and y. Other commonly used  errors-in-variables methods, such as orthogonal
    distance regression, geometric mean regression or Deming regression are special
    cases of York\xE2\u20AC\u2122s solution."
