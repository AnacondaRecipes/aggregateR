  summary: How to fit a straight line through a set of points with errors in both coordinates?
    The 'bfsl' package implements the York regression (York, 2004 <doi:10.1119/1.1632486>).
    It provides unbiased estimates of the intercept, slope and standard errors for the
    best-fit straight line to independent points with (possibly correlated) normally
    distributed errors in both x and y. Other commonly used errors-in-variables methods,
    such as orthogonal distance regression, geometric mean regression or Deming regression
    are special cases of the 'bfsl' solution.
