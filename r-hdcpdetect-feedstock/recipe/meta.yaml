  summary: "Objective: Implement new methods for detecting change points in high-dimensional
    time series data. These new methods can be applied to non-Gaussian data, account
    for spatial and temporal dependence, and detect a wide variety of change-point configurations,
    including changes near the boundary and changes in close proximity. Additionally,
    this package helps address the \u201Csmall n, large p\u201D problem, which occurs
    in many research contexts. This problem arises when a dataset contains changes that
    are visually evident but do not rise to the level of statistical significance due
    to the small number of observations and large number of parameters. The problem
    is overcome by treating the dimensions as a whole and scaling the test statistics
    only by its standard deviation, rather than scaling each dimension individually.
    Due to the computational complexity of the functions, the package runs best on datasets
    with a relatively large number of attributes but no more than a few hundred observations."
