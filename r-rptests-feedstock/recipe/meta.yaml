  summary: Performs goodness of fits tests for both high and low-dimensional linear models. It
    can test for a variety of model misspecifications including nonlinearity and heteroscedasticity.
    In addition one can test the significance of potentially large groups of variables,
    and also produce p-values for the significance of individual variables in high-dimensional
    linear regression.
