  summary: 'Density discontinuity testing (a.k.a. manipulation testing) is commonly employed
    in regression discontinuity designs and other program evaluation settings to detect
    perfect self-selection (manipulation) around a cutoff where treatment/policy assignment
    changes. This package implements manipulation testing procedures using the local
    polynomial density estimators: rddensity() to construct test statistics and p-values
    given a prespecified cutoff, rdbwdensity() to perform data-driven bandwidth selection,
    and rdplotdensity() to construct density plots.'
