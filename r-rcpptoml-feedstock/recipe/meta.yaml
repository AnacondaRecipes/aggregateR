  summary: The configuration format defined by 'TOML' (which expands to "Tom's Obvious Markup
    Language") specifies an excellent format (described at <https://toml.io/en/>) suitable
    for both human editing as well as the common uses of a machine-readable format.
    This package uses 'Rcpp' to connect to the 'toml++' parser written by Mark Gillard
    to R.
