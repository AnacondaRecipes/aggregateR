  summary: Item response theory based methods are used to compute linking constants and conduct
    chain linking of unidimensional or multidimensional tests for multiple groups under
    a common item design.  The unidimensional methods include the Mean/Mean, Mean/Sigma,
    Haebara, and Stocking-Lord methods for dichotomous (1PL, 2PL and 3PL) and/or polytomous
    (graded response, partial credit/generalized partial credit, nominal, and multiple-choice
    model) items.  The multidimensional methods include the least squares method and
    extensions of the Haebara and Stocking-Lord method using single or multiple dilation
    parameters for multidimensional extensions of all the unidimensional dichotomous
    and polytomous item response models.  The package also includes functions for importing
    item and/or ability parameters from common IRT software, conducting IRT true score
    and observed score equating, and plotting item response curves/surfaces, vector
    plots, information plots, and comparison plots for examining parameter drift.
