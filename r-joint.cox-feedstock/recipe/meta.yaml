  summary: Fit survival data and perform dynamic prediction under joint frailty-copula models
    for tumour progression and death. Likelihood-based methods are employed for estimating
    model parameters, where the baseline hazard functions are modeled by the cubic M-spline
    or the Weibull model. The methods are applicable for meta-analytic data containing
    individual-patient information from several studies. Survival outcomes need information
    on both terminal event time (e.g., time-to-death) and non-terminal event time (e.g.,
    time-to-tumour progression). Methodologies were published in Emura et al. (2017)
