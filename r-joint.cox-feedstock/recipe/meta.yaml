  summary: Perform likelihood estimation and dynamic prediction under joint frailty-copula models
    for tumour progression and death in meta-analysis. A penalized likelihood method
    is employed for estimating model parameters, where the baseline hazard functions
    are modeled by smoothing splines. The methods are applicable for meta-analytic data
    combining several studies. The methods can analyze data having information on both
    terminal event time (e.g., time-to-death) and non-terminal event time (e.g., time-to-tumour
    progression). See Emura et al. (2017) <doi:10.1177/0962280215604510> for likelihood
    estimation, and Emura et al. (2018) <doi:10.1177/0962280216688032> for dynamic prediction.
    More details on these methods can also be found in a book of Emura et al. (2019)
    <10.1007/978-981-13-3516-7>. Survival data from ovarian cancer patients are also
    available.
