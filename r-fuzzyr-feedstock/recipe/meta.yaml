  summary: Design and simulate fuzzy logic systems using Type-1 and Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic.
    This toolkit includes with graphical user interface (GUI) and an adaptive neuro-
    fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). This toolkit is a continuation from the previous
    package ('FuzzyToolkitUoN'). Produced by the Intelligent Modelling & Analysis Group
    (IMA) and Lab for UnCertainty In Data and decision making (LUCID), University of
    Nottingham. A big thank you to the many people who have contributed to the development/evaluation
    of the toolbox. Please cite the toolbox and the corresponding paper <doi:10.1109/FUZZ48607.2020.9177780>
