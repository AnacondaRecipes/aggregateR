  summary: "Implements novel nonparametric approaches to address biases and confounding when
    comparing treatments or exposures in observational studies of outcomes. While designed
    and appropriate for use in studies involving medicine and the life sciences, the
    package can be used in other situations involving outcomes with multiple confounders.
    The package implements a family of methods for non-parametric bias correction when
    comparing treatments in observational studies, including survival analysis settings,
    where competing risks and/or censoring may be present. The approach extends to bias-corrected
    personalized predictions of treatment outcome differences, and analysis of heterogeneity
    of treatment effect-sizes across patient subgroups. For further details, please
