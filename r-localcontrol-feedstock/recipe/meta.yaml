  summary: Implements novel nonparametric approaches to address biases and confounding when comparing
    treatments or exposures in observational studies of outcomes. While designed and
    appropriate for use in studies involving medicine and the life sciences, the package
    can be used in other situations involving outcomes with multiple confounders. The
    package implements a family of methods for non-parametric bias correction when comparing
    treatments in observational studies, including survival analysis settings, where
    competing risks and/or censoring may be present. The approach extends to bias-corrected
    personalized predictions of treatment outcome differences, and analysis of heterogeneity
    of treatment effect-sizes across patient subgroups.
