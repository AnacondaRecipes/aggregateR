  summary: Provides tools for simulating from continuous-time individual level models of disease
    transmission, and carrying out infectious disease data analyses with the same models.
    The epidemic models considered are distance-based and/or contact network-based models
    within Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) or Susceptible-Infectious-Notified-Removed
    (SINR) compartmental frameworks.
