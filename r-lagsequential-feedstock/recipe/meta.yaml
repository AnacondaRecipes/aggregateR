  summary: Lag-sequential analysis is a method of assessing of patterns (what tends to  follow
    what?) in sequences of codes. The codes are typically for discrete  behaviors or
    states. The functions in this package read a stream of codes, or a frequency transition
    matrix, and produce a variety of lag sequential   statistics, including transitional
    frequencies, expected transitional frequencies,  transitional probabilities, z values,
    adjusted residuals, Yule's Q values,  likelihood ratio tests of stationarity across
    time and homogeneity across groups  or segments, transformed kappas for unidirectional
    dependence, bidirectional  dependence, parallel and nonparallel dominance, and significance
    levels based on  both parametric and randomization tests. The methods are described
    in Bakeman & Quera (2011) <doi:10.1017/CBO9781139017343>, O'Connor (1999) <doi:10.3758/BF03200753>,
    Wampold & Margolin (1982) <doi:10.1037/0033-2909.92.3.755>, and Wampold (1995, ISBN:0-89391-919-5).
