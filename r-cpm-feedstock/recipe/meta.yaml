  summary: Sequential and batch change detection for univariate data streams, using the change
    point model framework. Functions are provided to allow nonparametric distribution-free
    change detection in the mean, variance, or general distribution of a given sequence
    of observations. Parametric change detection methods are also provided for Gaussian,
    Bernoulli and Exponential sequences. Both the batch (Phase I) and sequential (Phase
    II) settings are supported, and the sequences may contain either a single or multiple
    change points. A full description of this package is available in Ross, G.J (2015)
