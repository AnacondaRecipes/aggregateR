  summary: ' Fast imputations under the object-oriented programming paradigm. There was used
    quantitative models with a closed-form solution. Thus package is based on linear
    algebra operations. The biggest improvement in time performance could be achieve
    for a calculation where a grouping variable have to be used. A single evaluation
    of a quantitative model for the multiple imputations is another major enhancement.
    Moreover there are offered a few functions built to work with popular R packages
    such as ''data.table'' or ''dplyr''.'
