  summary: Fast imputations under the object-oriented programming paradigm. Moreover there are
    offered a few functions built to work with popular R packages such as 'data.table'
    or 'dplyr'. The biggest improvement in time performance could be achieve for a calculation
    where a grouping variable have to be used. A single evaluation of a quantitative
    model for the multiple imputations is another major enhancement. A new major improvement
    is one of the fastest predictive mean matching in the R world because of presorting
    and binary search.
