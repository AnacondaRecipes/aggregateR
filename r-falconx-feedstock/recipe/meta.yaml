  summary: 'This is a method for Allele-specific DNA Copy Number profiling for whole-Exome sequencing
    data.  Given the allele-specific coverage and site biases at the variant loci, this
    program segments the genome into regions of homogeneous allele-specific copy number.  It
    requires, as input, the read counts for each variant allele in a pair of case and
    control samples, as well as the site biases. For detection of somatic mutations,
    the case and control samples can be the tumor and normal sample from the same individual.  The
    implemented method is based on the paper: Chen, H., Jiang, Y., Maxwell, K., Nathanson,
    K. and Zhang, N. (under review). Allele-specific copy number estimation by whole
    Exome sequencing.'
