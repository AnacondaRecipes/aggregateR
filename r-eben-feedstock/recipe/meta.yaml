  summary: Provides the Empirical Bayesian Elastic Net for handling multicollinearity in generalized
    linear regression models.  As a special case of the 'EBglmnet' package (also available
    on CRAN), this package encourages a grouping effects to select relevant variables
    and estimate the corresponding non-zero effects.
