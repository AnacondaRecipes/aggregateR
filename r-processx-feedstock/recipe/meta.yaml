  summary: Tools to run system processes in the background. It can check if a background process
    is running; wait on a background process to finish; get the exit status of finished
    processes; kill background processes and their children; restart processes. It can
    read the standard output and error of the processes, using non-blocking connections.
    'processx' can poll a process for standard output or error, with a timeout. It can
    also poll several processes at once.
