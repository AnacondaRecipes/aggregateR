  summary: Tools to run system processes in the background. It can check if a background process
    is running; wait on a background process to finish; get the exit status of finished
    processes; kill background processes. It can read the standard output and error
    of the processes, using non-blocking connections. 'processx' can poll a process
    for standard output or error, with a timeout. It can also poll several processes
    at once.
