  summary: A fast implementation of Random Forests, particularly suited for high dimensional
    data. Ensembles of classification, regression, survival and probability prediction
    trees are supported. Data from genome-wide association studies can be analyzed efficiently.
    In addition to data frames, datasets of class 'gwaa.data' (R package 'GenABEL')
    and 'dgCMatrix' (R package 'Matrix')  can be directly analyzed.
