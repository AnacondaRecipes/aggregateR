  summary: Fits the autologistic model described in Besag's famous 1974 paper on auto- models
    <http://www.jstor.org/stable/2984812>. Fits a multicategory generalization of the
    autologistic model when there are more than 2 response categories. Provides support
    for both asymptotic and bootstrap confidence intervals. For full model descriptions
    and a guide to the use of this package, please see the vignette.
