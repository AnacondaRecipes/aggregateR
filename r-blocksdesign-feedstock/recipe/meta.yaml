  summary: 'Constructs D-optimal or near D-optimal nested and crossed  block designs for unstructured
    or general factorial treatment designs.  The treatment design, if required, is found
    from a model matrix design formula and can be added sequentially, if required. The
    block design is found from a defined set of block factors and is conditional on
    the defined treatment design.    The block factors are added in sequence and each
    added block factor is optimized conditional on all previously added block factors.
    The block design can have repeated nesting down to any required  depth of nesting
    with either simple nested blocks or a crossed blocks design at each level of nesting.
    Outputs include a table showing the allocation of treatments to blocks and tables
    showing the achieved D-efficiency factors for each block and treatment design. '
