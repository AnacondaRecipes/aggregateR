  summary: "Constructs treatment and block designs for linear treatment models with crossed or
    nested block factors. The treatment design can be any feasible linear model and
    the block design can be any feasible combination of crossed or nested block factors.
    The block design is a sum of one or more block factors and the block design is optimized
    sequentially with the levels of each successive block factor optimized conditional
    on all previously optimized block factors. D-optimality is used throughout except
    for square or rectangular lattice block designs which are constructed algebraically
    using mutually orthogonal Latin squares. Crossed block designs with interaction
    effects are optimized using a weighting scheme which allows for differential weighting
    of first and second-order block effects. Outputs include a table showing the allocation
    of treatments to blocks and tables showing the achieved D-efficiency factors for
    each block and treatment design. Edmondson, R.N. Multi-level Block Designs for Comparative
    Experiments. JABES 25, 500\u2013522 (2020) <doi:10.1007/s13253-020-00416-0>."
