  summary: Facilitates analysis of paleontological sequences of trait values.   Functions are
    provided to fit, using maximum likelihood, simple  evolutionary models (including
    unbiased random walks, directional  evolution,stasis, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, covariate-tracking)
    and  complex models (punctuation, mode shifts).
