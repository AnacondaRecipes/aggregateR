  summary: User-friendly interface utilities for MCMC models via Just Another Gibbs Sampler (JAGS),
    facilitating the use of parallel (or distributed) processors for multiple chains,
    automated control of convergence and sample length diagnostics, and evaluation of
    the performance of a model using drop-k validation or against simulated data. Template
    model specifications can be generated using a standard lme4-style formula interface
    to assist users less familiar with the BUGS syntax.  A JAGS extension module provides
    additional distributions including the Pareto family of distributions, the DuMouchel
    prior and the half-Cauchy prior.
