  summary: The rpsychi offers a number of functions for psychiatry, psychiatric nursing, clinical
    psychology. Functions are primarily for statistical significance testing using published
    work. For example, you can conduct a factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA), which
    requires only the mean, standard deviation, and sample size for each cell, rather
    than the individual data. This package covers fundamental statistical tests such
    as t-test, chi-square test, analysis of variance, and multiple regression analysis.
    With some exceptions, you can obtain effect size and its confidence interval. These
    functions help you to obtain effect size from published work, and then to conduct
    a priori power analysis or meta-analysis, even if a researcher do not report effect
    size in a published work.
