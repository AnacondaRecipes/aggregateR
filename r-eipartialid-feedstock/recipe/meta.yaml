  summary: Estimate district-level bounds for 2x2 ecological inference based on the approach  described
    in the forthcoming article Jiang et al. (2019), "Ecological Regression with Partial
    Identification", Political Analysis. Interval data regression is used to bound the  nonidentified
    regression parameter in a linear contextual effects model, from which  district-level
    bounds are derived. The approach here can be useful as a baseline of comparison
    for future work on ecological inference.
