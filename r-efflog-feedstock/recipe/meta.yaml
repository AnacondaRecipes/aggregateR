  summary: Fitting a causal loglinear model and calculating the causal effects for a causal loglinear
    model with the multiplicative interaction or without the multiplicative interaction,
    obtaining the natural direct, indirect and the total effect. It calculates also
    the cell effect, which is a new interaction effect.
