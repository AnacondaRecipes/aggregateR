  summary: Functions aiming to facilitate the analysis of the structure of animal acoustic signals
    in 'R'. 'warbleR' makes use of the basic sound analysis tools from the package 'seewave',
    and offers new tools for acoustic structure analysis. The main features of the package
    are the use of loops to apply tasks through acoustic signals referenced in a selection
    (annotation) table and the production of spectrograms in image files that allow
    to organize data and verify acoustic analyzes. The package offers functions to explore,
    organize and manipulate multiple sound files, explore and download 'Xeno-Canto'
    recordings, detect signals automatically, create spectrograms of complete recordings
    or individual signals, run different measures of acoustic signal structure, evaluate
    the performance of measurement methods, catalog signals, characterize different
    structural levels in acoustic signals, run statistical analysis of duet coordination
    and consolidate databases and annotation tables, among others.
