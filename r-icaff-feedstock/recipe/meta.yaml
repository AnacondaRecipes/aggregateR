  summary: 'Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialist_competitive_algorithm>
    is a computational method that is used to solve optimization problems of different
    types and it is the mathematical model and the computer simulation of human social
    evolution.   The package provides a minimum value for the cost function and the
    best value for the optimization variables by Imperialist Competitive Algorithm.  Users
    can easily define their own objective function depending on the problem at hand.  This
    version has been successfully applied to solve optimization problems, for continuous
    functions. '
