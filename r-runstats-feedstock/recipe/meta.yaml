  summary: 'Provides methods for fast computation of running sample statistics for time series.
    These include: (1) mean, (2) standard deviation, and (3) variance over a fixed-length
    window of time-series, (4) correlation, (5) covariance, and (6) Euclidean distance
    (L2 norm) between short-time pattern and time-series. Implemented methods utilize
    Convolution Theorem to compute convolutions via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).'
