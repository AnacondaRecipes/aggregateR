  summary: A tool for inferring kinase activity changes from  phosphoproteomics data. 'pKSEA'
    uses kinase-substrate  prediction scores to weight observed changes in  phosphopeptide
    abundance to calculate a phosphopeptide-level  contribution score, then sums up
    these contribution scores by  kinase to obtain a phosphoproteome-level kinase activity  change
    score (KAC score). 'pKSEA' then assesses the  significance of changes in predicted
    substrate abundances for  each kinase using permutation testing. This results in
    a  permutation score (pKSEA significance score) reflecting the  likelihood of a
    similarly high or low KAC from random chance,  which can then be interpreted in
    an analogous manner to an  empirically calculated p-value. 'pKSEA' contains default  databases
    of kinase-substrate predictions from 'NetworKIN'  (NetworKINPred_db) <http://networkin.info>  Horn,
    et. al (2014) <doi:10.1038/nmeth.2968> and of known kinase-substrate links from
    'PhosphoSitePlus'  (KSEAdb) <https://www.phosphosite.org/> Hornbeck PV, et. al (2015)
