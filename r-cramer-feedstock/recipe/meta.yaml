  summary: Provides R routine for the so called two-sample Cramer-Test.  This nonparametric two-sample-test
    on equality of the underlying distributions can be applied to multivariate data
    as well as univariate data. It offers two possibilities to approximate the critical
    value both of which are included in this package.
