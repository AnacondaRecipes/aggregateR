  summary: One haplotype is a combination of SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) within the
    QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci). clusterhap groups together all individuals of a population
    with the same haplotype. Each group contains individual with the same allele in
    each SNP, whether or not missing data. Thus, clusterhap groups individuals, that
    to be imputed, have a non-zero probability of having the same alleles in the entire
    sequence of SNP's. Moreover, clusterhap calculates such probability from relative
    frequencies.
