  summary: Quantitative trait loci mapping and genome wide association analysis are used to find
    candidate molecular marker or region associated with phenotype based on linkage
    analysis and linkage disequilibrium. Gene expression quantitative trait loci mapping
    is used to find candidate molecular marker or region associated with gene expression.
    In this package, we applied the method in Liu W. (2011) <doi:10.1007/s00122-011-1631-7>
    and Gusev A. (2016) <doi:10.1038/ng.3506> to genome and transcriptome wide association
    study, which is aimed at revealing the association relationship between phenotype
    and molecular markers, expression levels, molecular markers nested within different
    related expression effect and expression effect nested within different related
    molecular marker effect. F test based on full and reduced model are performed to
    obtain p value or likelihood ratio statistic. The best linear model can be obtained
    by stepwise regression analysis.
