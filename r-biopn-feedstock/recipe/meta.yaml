  summary: ' bioPN is a package suited to perform simulation of deterministic and stochastic
    systems of biochemical reaction networks. Models are defined using a subset of Petri
    Nets, in a way that is close at how chemical reactions are defined. For deterministic
    solutions, bioPN creates the associated system of differential equations "on the
    fly", and solves it with a Runge Kutta Dormand Prince 45 explicit algorithm. For
    stochastic solutions, bioPN offers variants of Gillespie algorithm, or SSA. For
    hybrid deterministic/stochastic, it employs the Haseltine and Rawlings algorithm,
    that partitions the system in fast and slow reactions. bioPN algorithms are developed
    in C to achieve adequate performance.'
