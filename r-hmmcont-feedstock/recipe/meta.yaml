  summary: The package includes the functions designed to analyse continuous observations processes
    with the Hidden Markov Model approach. They include Baum-Welch and Viterbi algorithms
    and additional visualisation functions. The observations are assumed to have Gaussian
    distribution and to be weakly stationary processes. The package was created for
    analyses of financial time series, but can also be applied to any continuous observations
    processes.
