  summary: A collection of functions for processing and analyzing metabolite data. The namesake
    function mrbin() converts 1D or 2D Nuclear Magnetic Resonance data into a matrix
    of values suitable for further data analysis and performs basic processing steps
    in a reproducible way. Negative values, a common issue in such data, can be replaced
    by positive values (<doi:10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00684>). All used parameters are
    stored in a readable text file and can be restored from that file to enable exact
    reproduction of the data at a later time. The function fia() ranks features according
    to their impact on classifier models, especially artificial neural network models.
