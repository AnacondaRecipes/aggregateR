  summary: Replace the standard x-axis in 'ggplots' with a combination matrix to visualize complex
    set overlaps. 'UpSet' has introduced a new way to visualize the overlap of sets
    as an alternative to Venn diagrams. This package provides a simple way to produce
    such plots using 'ggplot2'. In addition it can convert any categorical axis into
    a combination matrix axis.
