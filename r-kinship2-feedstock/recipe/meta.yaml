  summary: Routines to handle family data with a pedigree object. The initial purpose was to
    create correlation structures that describe family relationships such as kinship
    and identity-by-descent, which can be used to model family data in mixed effects
    models, such as in the coxme function. Also includes a tool for pedigree drawing
    which is focused on producing compact layouts without intervention. Recent additions
    include utilities to trim the pedigree object with various criteria, and kinship
    for the X chromosome.
