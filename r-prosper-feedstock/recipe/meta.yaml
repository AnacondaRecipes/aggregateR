  summary: 'An environment to simulate the development of annual plant populations with regard
    to population dynamics and genetics, especially herbicide resistance. It combines
    genetics on the individual level (Renton et al. 2011) with a stochastic development
    on the population level (Daedlow, 2015). Renton, M, Diggle, A, Manalil, S and Powles,
