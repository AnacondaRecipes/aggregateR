  summary: Given two unbiased samples of patient level data on cost and effectiveness for a pair
    of treatments, make head-to-head treatment comparisons by (i) generating the bivariate
    bootstrap resampling distribution of ICE uncertainty for a specified value of the
    shadow price of health, lambda, (ii) form the wedge-shaped ICE confidence region
    with specified confidence fraction within [0.50, 0.99] that is equivariant with
    respect to changes in lambda, (iii) color the bootstrap outcomes within the above
    confidence wedge with economic preferences from an ICE map with specified values
    of lambda, beta and gamma parameters, (iv) display VAGR and ALICE acceptability
    curves, and (v) illustrate variation in ICE preferences by displaying potentially
    non-linear indifference(iso-preference) curves from an ICE map with specified values
    of lambda, beta and either gamma or eta parameters.
