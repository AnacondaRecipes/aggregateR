  summary: 'Given two unbiased samples of patient level data on cost and effectiveness for a
    pair of treatments, make head-to-head treatment comparisons by (i) generating the
    bivariate bootstrap resampling distribution of ICE uncertainty for a specified value
    of the shadow price of health, lambda, (ii) form the wedge-shaped ICE confidence
    region with specified confidence fraction within [0.50, 0.99] that is equivariant
    with respect to changes in lambda, (iii) color the bootstrap outcomes within the
    above confidence wedge with economic preferences from an ICE map with specified
    values of lambda, beta and gamma parameters, (iv) display VAGR and ALICE acceptability
    curves, and (v) illustrate variation in ICE preferences by displaying potentially
    non-linear indifference(iso-preference) curves from an ICE map with specified values
    of lambda, beta and either gamma or eta parameters. '
