  license: MIT
  summary: It provides a generic set of tools for initializing a synthetic population with each
    individual in specific disease states, and making transitions between those disease
    states according to the rates calculated on each timestep. The new version 1.0.0
    has C++ code integration to make the functions run faster. It has also a higher
    level function to actually run the transitions for the number of timesteps that
    users specify. Additional functions will follow for changing attributes on demographic,
    health belief and movement.
