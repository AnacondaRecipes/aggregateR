  summary: 'Provides a variety of functions to analyze and model geostatistical count data with
    Gaussian copulas, including 1) data simulation and visualization; 2) correlation
    structure assessment (here also known as the Normal To Anything); 3) calculate multivariate
    normal rectangle probabilities; 4) likelihood inference and parallel prediction
    at predictive locations. Description of the method is available from: Han and DeOliveira
    (2018) <doi:10.18637/jss.v087.i13>.'
