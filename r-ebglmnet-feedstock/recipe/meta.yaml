  summary: 'Provides empirical Bayesian lasso and elastic net algorithms for variable selection
    and effect estimation. Key features include sparse variable selection and effect
    estimation via generalized linear regression models, high dimensionality with p>>n,
    and significance test for nonzero effects. This package outperforms other popular
    methods such as lasso and elastic net methods in terms of power of detection, false
    discovery rate, and power of detecting grouping effects. Please reference its use
    as A Huang and D Liu (2016) <doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btw143>.'
