  summary: Knowledge space theory by Doignon and Falmagne (1999) <doi:10.1007/978-3-642-58625-5>
    is a set- and order-theoretical framework, which proposes mathematical formalisms
    to operationalize knowledge structures in a particular domain. The 'kstMatrix' package  provides
    basic functionalities to generate, handle, and manipulate  knowledge structures
    and knowledge spaces. Opposed to the 'kst' package, 'kstMatrix' uses matrix representations
    for knowledge structures. Furthermore, 'kstMatrix' contains several knowledge spaces
    developed by the research group around Cornelia Dowling through querying experts.
