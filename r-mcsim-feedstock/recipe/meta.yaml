  summary: Identifies the optimal number of clusters by calculating the similarity between two
    clustering methods at the same number of clusters using the corrected indices of
    Rand and Jaccard as described in Albatineh and Niewiadomska-Bugaj (2011). The number
    of clusters at which the index attain its maximum more frequently is a candidate
    for being the optimal number of clusters.
