  summary: Provides HE plot and other functions for visualizing hypothesis tests in multivariate
    linear models. HE plots represent sums-of-squares-and-products matrices for linear
    hypotheses and for error using ellipses (in two dimensions) and ellipsoids (in three
    dimensions). The related 'candisc' package provides visualizations in a reduced-rank
    canonical discriminant space when there are more than a few response variables.
