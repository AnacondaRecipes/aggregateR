  summary: Implements the Stable Balancing Weights by Zubizarreta (2015) <DOI:10.1080/01621459.2015.1023805>.
    These are the weights of minimum variance that approximately balance the empirical
    distribution of the observed covariates. For an overview, see Chattopadhyay, Hase
    and Zubizarreta (2020) <DOI:10.1002/(ISSN)1097-0258>. To solve the optimization
    problem in 'sbw', the default solver is 'quadprog', which is readily available through
    CRAN. The solver 'osqp' is also posted on CRAN. To enhance the performance of 'sbw',
    users are encouraged to install other solvers such as 'gurobi' and 'Rmosek', which
    require special installation. For the installation of gurobi and pogs, please follow
    the instructions at <https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/quickstart_mac/r_ins_the_r_package.html>
    and <http://foges.github.io/pogs/stp/r>.
