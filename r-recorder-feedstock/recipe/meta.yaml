  summary: 'A lightweight toolkit to validate new observations when computing their predictions
    with a predictive model. The validation process  consists of two steps: (1) record
    relevant statistics and meta data of the variables in the original training data
    for the predictive model and (2) use these data to run a set of basic validation
    tests on the new set of  observations.'
