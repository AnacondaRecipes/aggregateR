  summary: Tools to assist in safely applying user generated objective and derivative function
    to optimization programs. These are primarily function minimization methods with
    at most bounds and masks on the parameters. Provides a way to check the basic computation
    of objective functions that the user provides, along with proposed gradient and
    Hessian functions, as well as to wrap such functions to avoid failures when inadmissible
    parameters are provided. Check bounds and masks. Check scaling or optimality conditions.
    Perform an axial search to seek lower points on the objective function surface.
    Includes forward, central and backward gradient approximation codes.
