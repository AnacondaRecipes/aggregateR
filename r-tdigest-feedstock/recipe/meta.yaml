  summary: The t-Digest construction algorithm, by Dunning et al., (2019) <arXiv:1902.04023v1>,
    uses a variant of 1-dimensional k-means clustering to produce a very compact data
    structure that allows accurate estimation of quantiles. This t-Digest data structure
    can be used to estimate quantiles, compute other rank statistics or even to estimate
    related measures like trimmed means. The advantage of the t-Digest over previous
    digests for this purpose is that the t-Digest handles data with full floating point
    resolution. The accuracy of quantile estimates produced by t-Digests can be orders
    of magnitude more accurate than those produced by previous digest algorithms. Methods
    are provided to create and update t-Digests and retrieve quantiles from the accumulated
    distributions.
