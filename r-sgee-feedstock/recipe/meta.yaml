  summary: Stagewise techniques implemented with Generalized Estimating Equations to handle individual,
    group, bi-level, and interaction selection. Stagewise approaches start with an empty
    model and slowly build the model over several iterations, which yields a 'path'
    of candidate models from which model selection can be performed. This 'slow brewing'
    approach gives stagewise techniques a unique flexibility that allows simple incorporation
    of Generalized Estimating Equations; see Vaughan, G., Aseltine, R., Chen, K., Yan,
    J., (2017) <doi:10.1111/biom.12669> for details.
