  summary: "Implementation of estimator ACME, described in Wolpert (2015), ACME: A  \t\tPartially
    Periodic Estimator of Avian & Chiropteran Mortality at Wind Turbines (submitted).
    Unlike most other models, this estimator supports decreasing-hazard Weibull model
    for persistence; decreasing search proficiency as carcasses age; variable bleed-through
    at successive searches; and interval mortality estimates. The package provides,
    based on search data, functions for estimating the mortality inflation factor in
    Frequentist and Bayesian settings."
