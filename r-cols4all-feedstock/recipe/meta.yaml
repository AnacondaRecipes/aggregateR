  summary: Color palettes for all people, including those with color vision deficiency. Popular
    color palette series have been organized by type and have been scored on several
    properties such as color-blind-friendliness and fairness (i.e. do colors stand out
    equally?). Own palettes can also be loaded and analysed. Besides the common palette
    types (categorical, sequential, and diverging) it also includes bivariate color
    palettes. Furthermore, a color for missing values is assigned to each palette.
