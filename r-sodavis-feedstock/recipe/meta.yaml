  summary: Variable and interaction selection are essential to classification in high-dimensional
    setting. In this package, we provide the implementation of SODA procedure, which
    is a forward-backward algorithm that selects both main and interaction effects under
    logistic regression and quadratic discriminant analysis. We also provide an extension,
    S-SODA, for dealing with the variable selection problem for semi-parametric models
    with continuous responses.
