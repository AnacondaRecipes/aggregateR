  summary: The correlations and linkage disequilibrium between tests can vary as a function of
    minor allele frequency thresholds used to filter variants, and also varies with
    different choices of test statistic for region-based tests. Appropriate genome-wide
    significance thresholds can be estimated empirically through permutation on only
    a small proportion of the whole genome.
