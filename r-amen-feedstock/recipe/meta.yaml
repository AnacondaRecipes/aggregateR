  summary: Analysis of dyadic network and relational data using additive and multiplicative effects
    (AME) models. The basic model includes regression terms, the covariance structure
    of the social relations model (Warner, Kenny and Stoto (1979) <DOI:10.1037/0022-3514.37.10.1742>,
    Wong (1982) <DOI:10.2307/2287296>), and multiplicative factor models (Hoff(2009)
    <DOI:10.1007/s10588-008-9040-4>). Several different link functions accommodate different
    relational data structures, including binary/network data, normal relational data,
    zero-inflated positive outcomes using a tobit model, ordinal relational data and
    data from fixed-rank nomination schemes. Several of these link functions are discussed
    in Hoff, Fosdick, Volfovsky and Stovel (2013) <DOI:10.1017/nws.2013.17>. Development
    of this software was supported in part by NIH grant R01HD067509.
