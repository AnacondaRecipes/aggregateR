  summary: Analysis of dyadic network and relational data using additive and multiplicative effects
    (AME) models. The basic model includes regression terms, the covariance structure
    of the social relations model (Warner, Kenny and Stoto (1979) <DOI:10.1037/0022-3514.37.10.1742>,  Wong
    (1982) <DOI:10.2307/2287296>), and multiplicative factor models (Hoff(2009) <DOI:10.1007/s10588-008-9040-4>).  Four
    different link functions accommodate different relational data structures, including
    binary/network data (bin), normal relational data (nrm), ordinal relational data
    (ord) and data from fixed-rank nomination schemes (frn).  Several of these link
    functions are discussed in Hoff, Fosdick, Volfovsky and Stovel (2013)  <DOI:10.1017/nws.2013.17>.
