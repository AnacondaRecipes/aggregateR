  summary: 'This package analyses complex ANOVA models with any combination of orthogonal/nested
    and fixed/random factors, as described by Underwood (1997). There are two restrictions:
    (i) data must be balanced; (ii) fixed nested factors are not allowed. Homogeneity
    of variances is checked using Cochran''s C test and ''a posteriori'' comparisons
    of means are done using Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) procedure.'
