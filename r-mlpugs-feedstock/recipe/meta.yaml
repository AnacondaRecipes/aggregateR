  summary: An implementation of classifier chains (CC's) for multi-label prediction. Users can
    employ an external package (e.g. 'randomForest', 'C50'), or supply their own. The
    package can train a single set of CC's or train an ensemble of CC's -- in parallel
    if running in a multi-core environment. New observations are classified using a
    Gibbs sampler since each unobserved label is conditioned on the others. The package
    includes methods for evaluating the predictions for accuracy and aggregating across
    iterations and models to produce binary or probabilistic classifications.
