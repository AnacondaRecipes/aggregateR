  summary: A program to generate smoothed quantiles for the Fst-heterozygosity distribution.
    Designed for use with large numbers of loci (e.g., genome-wide SNPs). The best case
    for analyzing the Fst-heterozygosity distribution is when many populations (>10)
    have been sampled. See Flanagan & Jones (2017) <doi:10.1093/jhered/esx048>.
