  summary: Nonlinear machine learning tool for classification, clustering and dimensionality
    reduction. It integrates 12 q-kernel functions and 15 conditional negative definite
    kernel functions and includes the  q-kernel and conditional negative definite kernel
    version of density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, spectral
    clustering, generalized discriminant analysis, principal component analysis, multidimensional
    scaling, locally linear embedding, sammon's mapping and t-Distributed stochastic
    neighbor embedding.
