  summary: High dimensional mixtures of Poisson Generalized Linear models with three different
    parameterizations of Poisson means are considered. Moreover, partitioning the response
    variables into a set of blocks is possible. The package estimates parameters via
    EM algorithm. For an efficient initialization, a random splitting small-EM is introduced.
