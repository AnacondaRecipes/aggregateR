  summary: For outlier detection in small and normally distributed  samples the ratio test of
    Dixon (Q-test) can be used. Density, distribution function, quantile function and
    random generation  for Dixon's ratio statistics are provided as wrapper functions.
    The core applies McBane's Fortran functions <doi:10.18637/jss.v016.i03>  that use
    Gaussian quadrature for a numerical solution.
