  summary: Implements network analysis and graph theory measures used in neuroscience, cognitive
    science, and psychology. Methods include various filtering methods and approaches
    such as threshold, dependency (Kenett, Tumminello, Madi, Gur-Gershgoren, Mantegna,
    & Ben-Jacob, 2010 <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0015032>), Information Filtering Networks
    (Barfuss, Massara, Di Matteo, & Aste, 2016 <doi:10.1103/PhysRevE.94.062306>), and
    Efficiency-Cost Optimization (Fallani, Latora, & Chavez, 2017 <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005305>).
    Brain methods include the recently developed Connectome Predictive Modeling (see
    references in package). Also implements several network measures including local
    network characteristics (e.g., centrality), community-level network characteristics
    (e.g., community centrality), global network characteristics (e.g., clustering coefficient),
    and various other measures associated with the reliability and reproducibility of
    network analysis.
