  summary: 'The SoundexBR package provides an algorithm for decoding names into phonetic codes,
    as pronounced in Portuguese. The goal is for homophones to be encoded to the same
    representation so that they can be matched despite minor differences in spelling.
    The algorithm mainly encodes consonants; a vowel will not be encoded unless it is
    the first letter. The soundex code resultant consists of a four digits long string
    composed by one letter followed by three numerical digits: the letter is the first
    letter of the name, and the digits encode the remaining consonants.'
