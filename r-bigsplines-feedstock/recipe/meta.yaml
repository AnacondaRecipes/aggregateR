  summary: 'Fits smoothing spline regression models using scalable algorithms designed for large
    samples. Seven marginal spline types are supported: linear, cubic, different cubic,
    cubic periodic, cubic thin-plate, ordinal, and nominal. Random effects and parametric
    effects are also supported. Response can be Gaussian or non-Gaussian: Binomial,
    Poisson, Gamma, Inverse Gaussian, or Negative Binomial.'
