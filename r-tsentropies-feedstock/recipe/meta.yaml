  summary: Computes various entropies of given time series. This is the initial version that
    includes ApEn() and SampEn() functions for calculating approximate entropy and sample
    entropy. Approximate entropy was proposed by S.M. Pincus in "Approximate entropy
    as a measure of system complexity", Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
    of the United States of America, 88, 2297-2301 (March 1991). Sample entropy was
    proposed by J. S. Richman and J. R. Moorman in "Physiological time-series analysis
    using approximate entropy and sample entropy", American Journal of Physiology, Heart
    and Circulatory Physiology, 278, 2039-2049 (June 2000). This package also contains
    FastApEn() and FastSampEn() functions for calculating fast approximate entropy and
    fast sample entropy. These are newly designed very fast algorithms, resulting from
    the modification of the original algorithms. The calculated values of these entropies
    are not the same as the original ones, but the entropy trend of the analyzed time
    series determines equally reliably. Their main advantage is their speed, which is
    up to a thousand times higher. A scientific article describing their properties
    has been submitted to The Journal of Supercomputing and in present time it is waiting
    for the acceptance.
