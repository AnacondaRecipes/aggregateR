  summary: Offers a suite of functions for converting to and from (atomic) vectors, matrices,
    data.frames, and (3D+) arrays as well as lists of these objects. It is an alternative
    to the base R as.<str>.<method>() functions (e.g., as.data.frame.array()) that provides
    more useful and/or flexible restructuring of R objects. To do so, it only works
    with common structuring of R objects (e.g., data.frames with only atomic vector
    columns).
