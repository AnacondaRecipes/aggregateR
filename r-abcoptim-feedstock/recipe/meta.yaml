  summary: An implementation of Karaboga (2005) Artificial Bee Colony Optimization algorithm
    <http://mf.erciyes.edu.tr/abc/pub/tr06_2005.pdf>. This (working) version is a Work-in-progress,
    which is why it has been implemented using pure R code. This was developed upon
    the basic version programmed in C and distributed at the algorithm's official website.
