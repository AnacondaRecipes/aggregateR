  summary: 'Implements semiparametric estimation and testing procedures for a continuous, possibly
    multivariate, mark-specific hazard ratio (treatment/placebo) of an event of interest
    in a randomized treatment efficacy trial with a time-to-event endpoint, as described
    in Juraska M and Gilbert PB (2013), Mark-specific hazard ratio model with multivariate
    continuous marks: an application to vaccine efficacy. Biometrics 69(2):328 337 <doi:10.1111/biom.12016>,
    and in Juraska M and Gilbert PB (2015), Mark-specific hazard ratio model with missing
    multivariate marks. Lifetime Data Analysis 22(4): 606-25 <doi:10.1007/s10985-015-9353-9>.
    The former considers continuous multivariate marks fully observed in all subjects
    who experience the event of interest, whereas the latter extends the previous work
    to allow multivariate marks that are subject to missingness-at-random. For models
    with missing marks, two estimators are implemented based on (i) inverse probability
    weighting (IPW) of complete cases, and (ii) augmentation of the IPW estimating functions
    by leveraging correlations between the mark and auxiliary data to ''impute'' the
    expected profile score vectors for subjects with missing marks. The augmented IPW
    estimator is doubly robust and recommended for use with incomplete mark data. The
    methods make two key assumptions: (i) the time-to-event is assumed to be conditionally
    independent of the mark given treatment, and (ii) the weight function in the semiparametric
    density ratio/biased sampling model is assumed to be exponential. Diagnostic testing
    procedures for evaluating validity of both assumptions are implemented. Summary
    and plotting functions are provided for estimation and inferential results.'
