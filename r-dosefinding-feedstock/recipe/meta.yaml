  summary: 'The DoseFinding package provides functions for the design and analysis of dose-finding
    experiments (with focus on pharmaceutical Phase II clinical trials). It provides
    functions for: multiple contrast tests, fitting non-linear dose-response models
    (using Bayesian and non-Bayesian estimation), calculating optimal designs and an
    implementation of the MCPMod methodology (Pinheiro et al. (2014) <doi:10.1002/sim.6052>).'
