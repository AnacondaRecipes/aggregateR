  summary: The development of ISM was made by Warfield in 1974. ISM is the process of collaborating
    distinct or related essentials into a simplified and an organized format. Hence,
    ISM is a methodology that seeks the interrelationships among the various elements
    considered and endows with a hierarchical and multilevel structure. To run this
    package user needs to provide a matrix (VAXO) converted into 0's and 1's. Warfield,J.N.
