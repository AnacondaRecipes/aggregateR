  summary: Provides the "enrich" method to enrich list-like R objects with new, relevant components.
    The current version has methods for enriching objects of class 'family', 'link-glm',
    'lm', 'glm' and 'betareg'. The resulting objects preserve their class, so all methods
    associated with them still apply. The package also provides the 'enriched_glm' function
    that has the same interface as 'glm' but results in objects of class 'enriched_glm'.
    In addition to the usual components in a `glm` object, 'enriched_glm' objects carry
    an object-specific simulate method and functions to compute the scores, the observed
    and expected information matrix, the first-order bias, as well as model densities,
    probabilities, and quantiles at arbitrary parameter values. The package can also
    be used to produce customizable source code templates for the structured implementation
    of methods to compute new components and enrich arbitrary objects.
