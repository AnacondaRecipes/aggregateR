  summary: Provides a dataset containing several color naming conventions established by multiple
    sources, along with associated color metadata. The package also provides related
    helper functions for mapping among the different Lego color naming conventions and
    between Lego colors, hex colors, and 'R' color names,  making it easy to convert
    any color palette to one based on existing Lego colors while keeping as close to
    the original color palette as possible. The functions use nearest color matching
    based on Euclidean distance in RGB space.  Naming conventions for color mapping
    include those from 'BrickLink' (<https://www.bricklink.com>), 'The Lego Group' (<https://www.lego.com>),
    'LDraw' (<https://www.ldraw.org/>), and 'Peeron' (<http://www.peeron.com/>).
