  summary: Enables investigation of the predictors of misreporting on sensitive survey questions
    through a multivariate list experiment regression method. The method permits researchers
    to model whether a survey respondent's answer to the sensitive item in a list experiment
    is different from his or her answer to an analogous direct question.
