  summary: Functions for hypothesis testing in single and double Wishart settings, based on Roy's
    largest root. This test statistic is especially useful in multivariate analysis.
    The computations are based on results by Chiani (2014) <DOI:10.1016/j.jmva.2014.04.002>
    and Chiani (2016) <DOI:10.1016/j.jmva.2015.10.007>. They use the fact that the CDF
    is related to the Pfaffian of a matrix that can be computed in a finite number of
    iterations. This package takes advantage of the Boost and Eigen C++ libraries to
    perform multi-precision linear algebra.
