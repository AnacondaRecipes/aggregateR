  summary: Provides a user-friendly way for the analysis of multinomial processing tree (MPT)
    models (e.g.,  Riefer, D. M., and Batchelder, W. H. [1988]. Multinomial modeling
    and the measurement of cognitive processes. Psychological Review, 95, 318-339) for
    single and multiple datasets. The main functions perform model fitting and model
    selection. Model selection can be done using AIC, BIC, or the Fisher Information
    Approximation (FIA) a measure based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) framework.
    The model and restrictions can be specified in external files or within an R script
    in an intuitive syntax or using the context-free language for MPTs. The 'classical'
    .EQN file format for model files is also supported. Besides MPTs, this package can
    fit a wide variety of other cognitive models such as SDT models (see fit.model).
    It also supports multicore fitting and FIA calculation (using the snowfall package),
    can generate or bootstrap data for simulations, and plot predicted versus observed
    data.
