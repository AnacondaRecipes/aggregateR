  summary: Convenience wrapper that uses the 'rmarkdown' package to render small snippets of
    code to target formats that include both code and output. The goal is to encourage
    the sharing of small, reproducible, and runnable examples on code-oriented websites,
    such as <http://stackoverflow.com> and <https://github.com>, or in email. 'reprex'
    also extracts clean, runnable R code from various common formats, such as copy/paste
    from an R session.
