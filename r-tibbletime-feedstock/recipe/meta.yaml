  summary: 'Built on top of the ''tibble'' package, ''tibbletime'' is an extension that allows
    for the creation of time aware tibbles. Some immediate advantages of this include:
    the ability to perform time-based subsetting on tibbles, quickly summarising and
    aggregating results by time periods, and creating columns that can be used as ''dplyr''
    time-based groups.'
