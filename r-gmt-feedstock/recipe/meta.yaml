  summary: Interface between the GMT map-making software and R, enabling the user to manipulate
    geographic data within R and call GMT commands to draw and annotate maps in postscript
    format. The gmt package is about interactive data analysis, rapidly visualizing
    subsets and summaries of geographic data, while performing statistical analysis
    in the R console.
