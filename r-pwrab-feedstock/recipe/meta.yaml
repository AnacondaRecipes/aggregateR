  summary: Power analysis for AB testing. The calculations are based on the Welch's unequal variances
    t-test, which is generally preferred over the Student's t-test when sample sizes
    and variances of the two groups are unequal, which is frequently the case in AB
    testing. In such situations, the Student's t-test will give  biased results due
    to using the pooled standard deviation, unlike the Welch's t-test.
