  summary: Provides user-friendly tools for calibration in survey sampling. The package is production-oriented,
    and its interface is inspired by the famous popular macro 'Calmar' for SAS, so that
    'Calmar' users can quickly get used to 'icarus'. In addition to calibration (with
    linear, raking and logit methods), 'icarus' features functions for calibration on
    tight bounds and penalized calibration.
