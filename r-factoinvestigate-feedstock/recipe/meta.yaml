  summary: Brings a set of tools to help and automatically realise the description of principal
    component analyses (from 'FactoMineR' functions). Detection of existing outliers,
    identification of the informative components, graphical views and dimensions description
    are performed threw dedicated functions. The Investigate() function performs all
    these functions in one, and returns the result as a report document (Word, PDF or
    HTML).
