  summary: 'Provides several functions to identify and analyse miRNA sponge, including popular
    methods for identifying miRNA sponge interactions, two types  of global ceRNA regulation
    prediction methods and four types of context-specific  prediction methods( Li Y
    et al.(2017) <doi:10.1093/bib/bbx137>), which are based  on miRNA-messenger RNA
    regulation alone, or by integrating heterogeneous data,  respectively. In addition,
    For predictive ceRNA relationship pairs, this package  provides several downstream
    analysis algorithms, including regulatory network  analysis and functional annotation
    analysis, as well as survival prognosis analysis based on expression of ceRNA ternary
    pair. '
