  summary: Provides several functions to identify and analyse miRNA sponge, including popular
    methods for identifying miRNA sponge interactions, two types of global ceRNA regulation
    prediction methods and four types of context-specific prediction methods( Li Y et
    al.(2017) <doi:10.1093/bib/bbx137>), which are based on miRNA-messenger RNA regulation
    alone, or by integrating heterogeneous data, respectively. In addition, For predictive
    ceRNA relationship pairs, this package provides several downstream analysis algorithms,
    including regulatory network analysis and functional annotation analysis, as well
    as survival prognosis analysis based on expression of ceRNA ternary pair.
