  summary: Performs multiple comparison procedures on curve observations among different treatment
    groups. The methods are applicable in a variety of situations (such as independent
    groups with equal or unequal sample sizes, or repeated measures) by using parametric
    bootstrap. References to these procedures can be found at Konietschke, Gel, and
    Brunner (2014) <doi:10.1090/conm/622/12431> and Westfall (2011) <doi:10.1080/10543406.2011.607751>.
