  summary: 'EZR (Easy R) adds a variety of statistical functions, including survival analyses,
    ROC analyses, metaanalyses, sample size calculation, and so on, to the R commander.
    EZR enables point-and-click easy access to statistical functions, especially for
    medical statistics. EZR is platform-independent and runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and
    UNIX. Its complete manual is available only in Japanese (Chugai Igakusha, ISBN:
    978-4-498-10918-6, Nankodo, ISBN: 978-4-524-26158-1, Ohmsha, ISBN: 978-4-274-22632-8),
    but an report that introduced the investigation of EZR was published in Bone Marrow
    Transplantation (Nature Publishing Group) as an Open article. This report can be
    used as a simple manual. It can be freely downloaded from the journal website as
    shown below. This report has been cited in approximately 10,000 scientific articles.'

# Copyright: The functionos in EZR package were programmed by Y. Kanda, except for the following functions. dot.plot(), prop.conf(), Cochran.Q.test(), pairwise.prop2.test(), pairwise.pairedt.test(), pairwise.kruskal.test(), pairwise.friedman.test(), pairwise.logrank.test(), pairwise.gray.test(), Steel.Dwass(), Steel(), pdunnet(), Mantel.Byar() were modified from the corresponding functions distributed by professor Aoki (http://aoki2.si.gunma-u.ac.jp/R). crr() and cuminc() were derived from cmprsk package. nrisk() was modified from survplot package (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/~eklund/survplot/). epi.test() and epi.kappa() were derived from epiR package. jonckheere.test(), ph2simon() and ph2single() were derived from clinfun package. Functions of meta-analysis were derived from meta and metatest packages. Functions of matched-pair analysis were derived from Matching. Functions of receiver-operating characteristics curve analyses were derived from pROC package. Many dialog functions in EZR were modified from the corresponding functions in Rcmdr package and RcmdrPlugin.survivalT package.
