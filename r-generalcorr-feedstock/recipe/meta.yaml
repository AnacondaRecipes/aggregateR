  summary: 'Function gmcmtx0() computes a more reliable (general) correlation matrix. Since causal
    paths from data are important for all sciences, the package provides many sophisticated
    functions. causeSummBlk() and causeSum2Blk() give easy-to-interpret causal paths.  Let
    Z denote control variables and compare two flipped kernel regressions: X=f(Y, Z)+e1
    and Y=g(X, Z)+e2. Our criterion Cr1 says that if |e1*Y|>|e2*X| then variation in
    X is more "exogenous or independent" than in Y, and the causal path is X to Y. Criterion
    Cr2 requires |e2|<|e1|. These inequalities between many absolute values are quantified
    by four orders of stochastic dominance. Our third criterion Cr3, for the causal
    path X to Y, requires new generalized partial correlations to satisfy |r*(x|y,z)|<
    |r*(y|x,z)|. The function parcorVec() reports generalized partials between the first
    variable and all others.  The package provides several R functions including get0outliers()
    for outlier detection, bigfp() for numerical integration by the trapezoidal rule,
    stochdom2() for stochastic dominance, pillar3D() for 3D charts, canonRho() for generalized
    canonical correlations, depMeas() measures nonlinear dependence, and causeSummary(mtx)
    reports summary of causal paths among matrix columns. Portfolio selection: decileVote(),
    momentVote(), dif4mtx(), exactSdMtx() can rank several stocks. Functions whose names
    begin with ''boot'' provide bootstrap statistical inference, including a new bootGcRsq()
    test for "Granger-causality" allowing nonlinear relations. A new tool for evaluation
    of out-of-sample portfolio performance is outOFsamp(). Panel data implementation
    is now included. See eight vignettes of the package for theory, examples, and usage
    tips. See Vinod (2019) \doi{10.1080/03610918.2015.1122048}.'

# Description: Function gmcmtx0() computes a more reliable (general) correlation matrix. Since causal paths from data are important for all sciences, the package provides many sophisticated functions. causeSummBlk() and causeSum2Blk() give easy-to-interpret causal paths.  Let Z denote control variables and compare two flipped kernel regressions: X=f(Y, Z)+e1 and Y=g(X, Z)+e2. Our criterion Cr1 says that if |e1*Y|>|e2*X| then variation in X is more "exogenous or independent" than in Y, and the causal path is X to Y. Criterion Cr2 requires |e2|<|e1|. These inequalities between many absolute values are quantified by four orders of stochastic dominance. Our third criterion Cr3, for the causal path X to Y, requires new generalized partial correlations to satisfy |r*(x|y,z)|< |r*(y|x,z)|.
