  summary: Tools for the analysis of epidemiological and surveillance data. Contains functions
    for directly and indirectly adjusting measures of disease frequency, quantifying
    measures of association on the basis of single or multiple strata of count data
    presented in a contingency table, computation of confidence intervals around incidence
    risk and incidence rate estimates and sample size calculations for cross-sectional,
    case-control and cohort studies. Surveillance tools include functions to calculate
    an appropriate sample size for 1- and 2-stage representative freedom surveys, functions
    to estimate surveillance system sensitivity and functions to support scenario tree
    modelling analyses.
