  summary: Tools for the analysis of epidemiological data. Contains functions for directly and
    indirectly adjusting measures of disease frequency, quantifying measures of association
    on the basis of single or multiple strata of count data presented in a contingency
    table, and computing confidence intervals around incidence risk and incidence rate
    estimates. Miscellaneous functions for use in meta-analysis, diagnostic test interpretation,
    and sample size calculations.
