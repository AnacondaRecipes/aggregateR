  summary: 'Primarily devoted to implementing the Univariate Bootstrap (as well as the Traditional
    Bootstrap). In addition there are multiple functions for DeFries-Fulker behavioral
    genetics models. The univariate bootstrapping functions, DeFries-Fulker functions,
    regression and traditional bootstrapping functions form the original core. Additional
    features may come online later, however this software is a work in progress. For
    more information about univariate bootstrapping see: Lee and Rodgers (1998) and
    Beasley et al (2007) <doi.org/10.1037/1082-989X.12.4.414>.'
