  summary: A revision to the stats::ks.test() function and the associated ks.test.Rd help page.
    With one minor exception, it does not change the existing behavior of ks.test(),
    and it adds features necessary for doing one-sample tests with hypothesized discrete
    distributions. The package also contains cvm.test(), for doing one-sample Cramer-von
    Mises goodness-of-fit tests.
