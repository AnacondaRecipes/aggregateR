  summary: Fits sparse interaction models for continuous and binary responses subject to the
    strong (or weak) hierarchy restriction that an interaction between two variables
    only be included if both (or at least one of) the variables is included as a main
    effect.  For more details, see Bien, J., Taylor, J., Tibshirani, R., (2013) "A Lasso
    for Hierarchical Interactions." Annals of Statistics. 41(3). 1111-1141.
