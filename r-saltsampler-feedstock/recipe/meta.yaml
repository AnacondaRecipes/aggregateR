  summary: The SALTSampler package facilitates Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling of random
    variables on a simplex. A Self-Adjusting Logit Transform (SALT) proposal is used
    so that sampling is still efficient even in difficult cases, such as those in high
    dimensions or with parameters that differ by orders of magnitude. Special care is
    also taken to maintain accuracy even when some coordinates approach 0 or 1 numerically.
    Diagnostic and graphic functions are included in the package, enabling easy assessment
    of the convergence and mixing of the chain within the constrained space.
