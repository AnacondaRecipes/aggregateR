  summary: An ADMM implementation of SDP-1, a semidefinite programming relaxation of the maximum
    likelihood estimator for fitting a block model. SDP-1 has a tendency to produce
    equal-sized blocks and is ideal for producing a form of network histogram approximating
    a nonparametric graphon model. Alternatively, it can be used for community detection.
    (This is experimental code, proceed with caution.)
