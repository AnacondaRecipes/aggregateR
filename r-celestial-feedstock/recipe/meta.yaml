  summary: Contains a number of common astronomy conversion routines, particularly the HMS and
    degrees schemes, which can be fiddly to convert between on mass due to the textural
    nature of the former. It allows users to coordinate match datasets quickly. It also
    contains functions for various cosmological calculations.
