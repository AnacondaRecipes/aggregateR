  summary: This package provides robust estimation for generalized additive models. It implements
    a fast and stable algorithm in Wong, Yao and Lee (2013). The implementation also
    contains three automatic selection methods for smoothing parameter. They are designed
    to be robust to outliers. For more details, see Wong, Yao and Lee (2013).
