  summary: Defines window or bin boundaries for the analysis of genomic data. Boundaries are
    based on the inflection points of a cubic smoothing spline fitted to the raw data.
    Along with defining boundaries, a technique to evaluate results obtained from unequally-sized
    windows is provided. Applications are particularly pertinent for, though not limited
    to, genome scans for selection based on variability between populations (e.g. using
    Wright's fixations index, Fst, which measures variability in subpopulations relative
    to the total population).
