  summary: The package compiles functions for calculating prices of American put options with
    Least Squares Monte Carlo method. The option types are plain vanilla American put,
    Asian American put, and Quanto American put. The pricing algorithms include variance
    reduction techniques such as Antithetic Variates and Control Variates. Additional
    functions are given to derive "price surfaces" at different volatilities and strikes,
    create 3-D plots, quickly generate Geometric Brownian motion, and calculate prices
    of European options with Black & Scholes analytical solution.
