  summary: 'The model, developed at the Vienna University of Technology, is a lumped conceptual
    rainfall-runoff model, following the structure of the HBV model. The model can also
    be run in a semi-distributed fashion and with dual representation of soil layer.
    The model runs on a daily or shorter time step and consists of a snow routine, a
    soil moisture routine and a flow routing routine. See Parajka, J., R. Merz, G. Bloeschl
