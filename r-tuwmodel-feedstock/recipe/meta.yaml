  summary: 'The model, developed at the Vienna University of Technology, is a lumped conceptual
    rainfall-runoff model, following the structure of the HBV model.  The model can
    also be run in a semi-distributed fashion. The model runs on a daily or shorter
    time step and consists of a snow routine, a soil moisture routine and a flow routing
    routine.  See Parajka, J., R. Merz, G. Bloeschl (2007) <DOI:10.1002/hyp.6253> Uncertainty
