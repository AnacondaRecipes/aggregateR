  summary: 'Simple functions for plotting linear calibration functions and estimating standard
    errors for measurements according to the Handbook of Chemometrics and Qualimetrics:
    Part A by Massart et al. (1997) There are also functions estimating the limit of
    detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ). The functions work on model objects
    from - optionally weighted - linear regression (lm) or robust linear regression
    (''rlm'' from the ''MASS'' package).'
