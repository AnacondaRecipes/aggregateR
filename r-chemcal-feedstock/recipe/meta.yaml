  summary: 'Simple functions for plotting linear calibration functions and estimating standard
    errors for measurements according to the Handbook of Chemometrics and Qualimetrics:
    Part A by Massart et al. There are also functions estimating the limit of detection
    (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ). The functions work on model objects from
    - optionally weighted - linear regression (lm) or robust linear regression (''rlm''
    from the ''MASS'' package).'
