  summary: EcoTroph is an approach and software for modelling marine and freshwater ecosystems.
    It is articulated entirely around trophic levels. EcoTroph's key displays are bivariate
    plots, with trophic levels as the abscissa, and biomass flows or related quantities
    as ordinates. Thus, trophic ecosystem functioning can be modelled as a continuous
    flow of biomass surging up the food web, from lower to higher trophic levels, due
    to predation and ontogenic processes. Such an approach, wherein species as such
    disappear, may be viewed as the ultimate stage in the use of the trophic level metric
    for ecosystem modelling, providing a simplified but potentially useful caricature
    of ecosystem functioning and impacts of fishing. This version contains catch trophic
    spectrum analysis (CTSA) function and corrected versions of the mf.diagnosis and
    create.ETmain functions.
