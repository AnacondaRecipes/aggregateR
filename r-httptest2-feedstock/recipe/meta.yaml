  summary: Testing and documenting code that communicates with remote servers can be painful.
    This package helps with writing tests for packages that use 'httr2'. It enables
    testing all of the logic on the R sides of the API without requiring access to the
    remote service, and it also allows recording real API responses to use as test fixtures.
    The ability to save responses and load them offline also enables writing vignettes
    and other dynamic documents that can be distributed without access to a live server.
