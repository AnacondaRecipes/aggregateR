  summary: Basic time series functionalities such as listing of missing values, application of
    arbitrary aggregation as well as rolling window functions and automatic detection
    of periodicity. As it is mainly based on 'data.table', it is fast and - in combination
    with the 'R6' package - offers reference semantics. In addition to its native R6
    interface, it provides an S3 interface inclusive an S3 wrapper method generator
    for those who prefer the latter.
