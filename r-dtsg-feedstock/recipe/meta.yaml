  summary: Basic time series functionalities such as listing of missing values, application of
    arbitrary aggregation as well as rolling (asymmetric) window functions and automatic
    detection of periodicity. As it is mainly based on 'data.table', it is fast and
    (in combination with the 'R6' package) offers reference semantics. In addition to
    its native R6 interface, it provides an S3 interface for those who prefer the latter.
    Finally yet importantly, its functional approach allows for incorporating functionalities
    from many other packages.
