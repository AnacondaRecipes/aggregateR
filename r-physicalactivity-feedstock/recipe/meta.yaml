  summary: 'It provides a function "wearingMarking" for classification of monitor wear and nonwear
    time intervals in accelerometer data collected to assess physical activity. The
    package also contains functions for making plot for  accelerometer data and obtaining
    the summary of various information including  daily monitor wear time and the mean
    monitor wear time during valid days.       The revised package version 0.2-1 improved
    the functions in the previous version regarding speed and robustness. In addition,
    several functions were added:  "markDelivery" can classify days for ActiGraph delivery
    by mail;  "markPAI" can categorize physical activity intensity level based on user-defined  cut-points
    of accelerometer counts. It also supports importing ActiGraph AGD files  with "readActigraph"
    and "queryActigraph" functions. The package also better supports time zones and
    daylight saving.'
