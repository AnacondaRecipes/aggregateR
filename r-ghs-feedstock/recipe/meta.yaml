  summary: Draw posterior samples to estimate the precision matrix for multivariate Gaussian
    data. Posterior means of the samples is the graphical horseshoe estimate by Li,
    Bhadra and Craig(2017) <arXiv:1707.06661>. The function uses matrix decomposition
    and variable change from the Bayesian graphical lasso by Wang(2012) <doi:10.1214/12-BA729>,
    and the variable augmentation for sampling under the horseshoe prior by Makalic
    and Schmidt(2016) <arXiv:1508.03884>. Structure of the graphical horseshoe function
    was inspired by the Bayesian graphical lasso function using blocked sampling, authored
    by Wang(2012) <doi:10.1214/12-BA729>.
