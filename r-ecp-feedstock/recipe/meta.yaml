  summary: Implements various procedures for finding  multiple change-points. Two methods make
    use of dynamic  programming and pruning, with no distributional  assumptions other
    than the existence of certain absolute  moments in one method. Hierarchical and
    exact search methods  are included. All methods return the set of estimated change-
    points as well as other summary information.
