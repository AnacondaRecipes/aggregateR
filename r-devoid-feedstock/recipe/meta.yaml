  summary: Provides a non-drawing graphic device for benchmarking purpose. In order to properly
    benchmark graphic drawing code it is necessary to factor out the device implementation
    itself so that results are not related to the specific graphics device used during
    benchmarking. The 'devoid' package implements a graphic device that accepts all
    the required calls from R's graphic engine but performs no action. Apart from benchmarking
    it is unlikely that this device has any practical use.
