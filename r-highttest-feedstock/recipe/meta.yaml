  summary: Implements the method developed by Cao and Kosorok (2011) for the significance analysis
    of thousands of features in high-dimensional biological studies. It is an asymptotically
    valid data-driven procedure to find critical values for rejection regions controlling
    the k-familywise error rate, false discovery rate, and the tail probability of false
    discovery proportion.
