  summary: 'Implements an automated binning of numeric variables and factors with respect to
    a dichotomous target variable. Two approaches are provided: An implementation of
    fine and coarse classing that merges granular classes and levels step by step. And
    a tree-like approach that iteratively segments the initial bins via binary splits.
    Both procedures merge, respectively split, bins based on similar weight of evidence
    (WOE) values and stop via an information value (IV) based criteria. The package
    can be used with single variables or an entire data frame. It provides flexible
    tools for exploring different binning solutions and for deploying them to (new)
    data.'
