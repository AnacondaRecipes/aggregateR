  summary: Calculates one-sample unbiased central moment estimates and two-sample pooled estimates
    up to 6th order, including estimates of powers and products of central moments.
    Provides the machinery for obtaining unbiased central moment estimators beyond 6th
    order by generating expressions for expectations of raw sample moments and their
    powers and products. Gerlovina and Hubbard (2019) <doi:10.1080/25742558.2019.1701917>.
