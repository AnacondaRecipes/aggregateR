  summary: Provides a set of functions to analyse overdispersed counts or proportions. Most of
    the methods are already available elsewhere but are scattered in different packages.
    The proposed functions should be considered as complements to more sophisticated
    methods such as generalized estimating equations (GEE) or generalized linear mixed
    effect models (GLMM).
