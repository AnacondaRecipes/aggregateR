  summary: Provides a simple wrapper for some 'XLConnect' functions. 'XLConnect' is a package
    that allows for reading, writing, and manipulating Microsoft Excel files. This package,
    'xlsimple', adds some documentation and pre-defined formatting to the outputted
    Excel file. Individual sheets can include a description on the first row to remind
    user what is in the data set. Auto filters and freeze rows are turned on. A brief
    readme file is created that provides a summary listing of the created sheets and,
    where provided, the description.
