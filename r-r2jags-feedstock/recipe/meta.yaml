  summary: Providing wrapper functions to implement Bayesian analysis in JAGS.  Some major features
    include monitoring convergence of a MCMC model using Rubin and Gelman Rhat statistics,
    automatically running a MCMC model till it converges, and implementing parallel
    processing of a MCMC model for multiple chains.
