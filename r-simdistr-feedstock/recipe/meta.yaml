  summary: Assessment of the distributions of baseline continuous and categorical variables in
    randomised trials. This method is based on the Carlisle-Stouffer method with Monte
    Carlo simulations. It calculates p-values for each trial baseline variable, as well
    as combined p-values for each trial - these p-values measure how compatible are
    distributions of trials baseline variables with random sampling. This package also
    allows for graphically plotting the cumulative frequencies of computed p-values.
    Please note that code was partly adapted from Carlisle JB, Loadsman JA. (2017) <doi:10.1111/anae.13650>.
