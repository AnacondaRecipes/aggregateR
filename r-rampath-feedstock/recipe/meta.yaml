  summary: We rewrite of RAMpath software developed by John McArdle and Steven Boker as an R
    package. In addition to performing regular SEM analysis through the R package lavaan,
    RAMpath has unique features.  First, it can generate path diagrams according to
    a given model. Second, it can display path tracing rules through path diagrams and
    decompose total effects into their respective direct and indirect effects as well
    as decompose variance and covariance into individual bridges. Furthermore, RAMpath
    can fit dynamic system models automatically based on latent change scores and generate
    vector field plots based upon results obtained from a bivariate dynamic system.
    Starting version 0.4, RAMpath can conduct power analysis for both univariate and
    bivariate latent change score models.
