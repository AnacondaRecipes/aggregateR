  summary: In gene sequencing methods, the topological features of protein-protein interaction
    (PPI) networks are often used, such as ToppNet <https://toppgene.cchmc.org>. In
    this study, a candidate gene prioritization method was proposed for non-communicable
    diseases considering disease risks transferred between genes in weighted disease
    PPI networks with weights for nodes and edges based on functional information.
