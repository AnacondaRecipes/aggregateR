  summary: Utilities for secure password hashing via the argon2 algorithm. It is a relatively
    new hashing algorithm and is believed to be very secure. The 'argon2' implementation
    included in the package is the reference implementation.  The package also includes
    some utilities that should be useful for digest authentication, including a wrapper
    of 'blake2b'.  For similar R packages, see sodium and 'bcrypt'.  See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2>
    or <https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/430.pdf> for more information.
