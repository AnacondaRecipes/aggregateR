  summary: Herein, we provide a broad variety of functions which are useful for handling, manipulating,
    and visualizing satellite-based remote sensing data. These operations range from
    mere data import and layer handling (eg subsetting), over Raster* typical data wrangling
    (eg crop, extend), to more sophisticated (pre-)processing tasks typically applied
    to satellite imagery (eg atmospheric and topographic correction). This functionality
    is complemented by a full access to the satellite layers' metadata at any stage
    and the documentation of performed actions in a separate log file. Currently available
    sensors include Landsat 4-5 (TM), 7 (ETM+), and 8 (OLI/TIRS Combined), and additional
    compatibility is ensured for the Landsat Global Land Survey data set.
