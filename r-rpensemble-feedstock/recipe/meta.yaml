  summary: 'Implements the methodology of "Cannings, T. I. and Samworth, R. J. (2017) Random-projection
    ensemble classification, J. Roy. Stat. Soc., Ser. B. (with discussion), 79, 959--1035".
    The random projection ensemble classifier is a general method for classification
    of high-dimensional data, based on careful combination of the results of applying
    an arbitrary base classifier to random projections of the feature vectors into a
    lower-dimensional space. The random projections are divided into non-overlapping
    blocks, and within each block the projection yielding the smallest estimate of the
    test error is selected. The random projection ensemble classifier then aggregates
    the results of applying the base classifier on the selected projections, with a
    data-driven voting threshold to determine the final assignment. '
