  summary: 'Cross-Entropy optimisation of unconstrained deterministic and noisy functions illustrated
    in Rubinstein and Kroese (2004, ISBN: 978-1-4419-1940-3) through a highly flexible
    and customisable function which allows user to define custom variable domains, sampling
    distributions, updating and smoothing rules, and stopping criteria. Several built-in
    methods and settings make the package very easy-to-use under standard optimisation
    problems.'
