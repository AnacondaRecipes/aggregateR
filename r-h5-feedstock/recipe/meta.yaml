  summary: S4 Interface to the 'HDF5' library supporting fast storage and retrieval of R-objects
    like vectors, matrices and arrays to binary files in a language independent format.
    The 'HDF5' format can therefore be used as an alternative to R's save/load mechanism.
    Since h5 is able to access only subsets of stored data it can also handle data sets
    which do not fit into memory.
