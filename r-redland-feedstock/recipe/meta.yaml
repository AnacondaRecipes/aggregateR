  summary: Provides methods to parse, query and serialize information stored in the Resource
    Description Framework (RDF). RDF is described at <http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer>.
    This package supports RDF by implementing an R interface to the Redland RDF C library,
    described at <http://librdf.org/docs/api/index.html>. In brief, RDF provides a structured
    graph consisting of Statements composed of Subject, Predicate, and Object Nodes.
