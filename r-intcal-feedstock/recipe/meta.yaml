  summary: The IntCal20 radiocarbon calibration curves (Reimer et al. 2020 <doi:10.1017/RDC.2020.68>)
    are provided here in a single data package, together with previous IntCal curves
    (IntCal13, IntCal09, IntCal04, IntCal98) and postbomb curves. Also provided are
    functions to copy the curves into memory, and to plot the curves and their underlying
    data, as well as functions to calibrate radiocarbon dates.
