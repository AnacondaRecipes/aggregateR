  summary: 'Provides item exclusion procedure, which is a formal method to  test ''Indifference
    Of iNdicator'' (ION). When a latent personality  trait-outcome association is assumed,
    then the association strength  should not depend on which subset of indicators (i.e.
    items) has been  chosen to reflect the trait. Personality traits are  often measured  (reflected)
    by  a sum-score of a certain set of indicators.  Item exclusion procedure randomly
    excludes items from a sum-score and  tests, whether the sum-score - outcome correlation
    changes. ION has been  achieved, when any item can be excluded from the sum-score
    without the  sum-score - outcome correlation substantially changing . For more details,  see
