  summary: This is a set of simple utilities for various data manipulation and testing tasks.  The
    goal is to use core R tools well, without bringing in many dependencies. Main areas
    of interest are semi-automated data frame manipulation, such as converting factors
    in multiple binary indicator columns. There are testing functions which provide
    'testthat' expectations to permute arguments to function calls. There are functions
    and data to test extreme numbers, dates, and bad input of various kinds which should
    allow testing failure and corner cases, which can be used for fuzzing your functions.
    The test suite has many examples of usage.
