  summary: A comprehensive implementation of dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithms in R.  DTW
    computes the optimal (least cumulative distance) alignment between points of two
    time series.  Common DTW variants covered include local (slope) and global (window)
    constraints, subsequence matches, arbitrary distance definitions, normalizations,
    minimum variance matching, and so on.  Provides cumulative distances, alignments,
    specialized plot styles, etc., as described in Giorgino (2009) <doi:10.18637/jss.v031.i07>.
