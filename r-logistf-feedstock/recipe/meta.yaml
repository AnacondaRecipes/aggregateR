  summary: Fit a logistic regression model using Firth's bias reduction method, equivalent to
    penalization of the log-likelihood by the Jeffreys prior. Confidence intervals for
    regression coefficients can be computed by penalized profile likelihood. Firth's
    method was proposed as ideal solution to the problem of separation in logistic regression,
    see Heinze and Schemper (2002) <doi:10.1002/sim.1047>. If needed, the bias reduction
    can be turned off such that ordinary maximum likelihood logistic regression is obtained.
    Two new modifications of Firth's method, FLIC and FLAC, lead to unbiased predictions
    and are now available in the package as well, see Puhr et al (2017) <doi:10.1002/sim.7273>.
