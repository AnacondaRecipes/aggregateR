  summary: 'An efficient tool designed for differential analysis of large-scale RNA sequencing
    (RNAseq) data and Bisulfite sequencing (BSseq) data in the presence of individual
    relatedness and population structure. ''PQLseq'' first fits a Generalized Linear
    Mixed Model (GLMM) with adjusted covariates, predictor of interest and random effects
    to account for population structure and individual relatedness, and then performs
    Wald tests for each gene in RNAseq or site in BSseq. '
