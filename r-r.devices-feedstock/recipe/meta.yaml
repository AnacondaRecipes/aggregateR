  summary: Functions for creating plots and image files in a unified way regardless of output
    format (EPS, PDF, PNG, SVG, TIFF, WMF, etc.). Default device options as well as
    scales and aspect ratios are controlled in a uniform way across all device types.
    Switching output format requires minimal changes in code. This package is ideal
    for large-scale batch processing, because it will never leave open graphics devices
    or incomplete image files behind, even on errors or user interrupts.
