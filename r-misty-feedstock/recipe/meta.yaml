  summary: Miscellaneous functions for descriptive statistics (e.g., frequency table, cross tabulation,
    multilevel descriptive statistics, multilevel R-squared measures, within-group and
    between-group correlation matrix, various effect size measures), data management
    (e.g., grand-mean and group-mean centering, coding variables and reverse coding
    items, scale and group scores, reading and writing SPSS and Excel files), missing
    data (e.g., descriptive statistics for missing data, missing data pattern, Little's
    test of Missing Completely at Random, and auxiliary variable analysis), item analysis
    (e.g., coefficient alpha and omega, multilevel confirmatory factor analysis, between-group
    and longitudinal measurement equivalence evaluation, cross-level measurement equivalence
    evaluation, and multilevel composite reliability), and statistical analysis (e.g.,
    confidence intervals, collinearity and residual diagnostics, dominance analysis,
    between- and within-subject analysis of variance, latent class analysis, t-test,
    z-test, sample size determination).
