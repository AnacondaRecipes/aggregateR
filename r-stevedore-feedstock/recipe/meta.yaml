  summary: Work with containers over the Docker API.  Rather than using system calls to interact
    with a docker client, using the API directly means that we can receive richer information
    from docker.  The interface in the package is automatically generated using the
    'OpenAPI' (a.k.a., 'swagger') specification, and all return values are checked in
    order to make them type stable.
