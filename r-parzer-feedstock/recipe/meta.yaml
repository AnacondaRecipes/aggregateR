  summary: Parse messy geographic coordinates from various character formats to decimal degree
    numeric values. Parse coordinates into their parts (degree, minutes, seconds); calculate
    hemisphere from coordinates; pull out individually degrees, minutes, or seconds;
    add and subtract degrees, minutes, and seconds. C++ code herein originally inspired
    from code written by Jeffrey D. Bogan, but then completely re-written.
