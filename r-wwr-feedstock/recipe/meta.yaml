  summary: Calculate the (weighted) win loss statistics including the win ratio, win difference
    and win product  and their variances, with which the p-values are also calculated.
    The variance estimation is based on  Luo et al. (2015) <doi:10.1111/biom.12225>
    and Luo et al. (2017) <doi:10.1002/sim.7284>. This package also calculates general
    win loss statistics with  user-specified win loss function with variance estimation
    based on  Bebu and Lachin (2016) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxv032>. This version
    corrected an error when outputting confidence interval for win difference.
