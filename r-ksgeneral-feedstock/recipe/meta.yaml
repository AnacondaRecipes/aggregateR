  summary: 'Computes a p-value of the one-sample two-sided (or one-sided, as a special case)
    Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic, for any fixed critical level, and an arbitrary,
    possibly large sample size for a pre-specified purely discrete, mixed or continuous
    cumulative distribution function (cdf) under the null hypothesis. If a data sample
    is supplied, ''KSgeneral'' computes the p-value corresponding to the value of the
    KS test statistic computed based on the user provided data sample. The package ''KSgeneral''
    implements a novel, accurate and efficient method named Exact-KS-FFT, expressing
    the p-value as a double-boundary non-crossing probability for a homogeneous Poisson
    process, which is then efficiently computed using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
    The package can also be used to compute and plot the complementary cdf of the KS
    statistic which is known to depend on the hypothesized distribution when the latter
    is discontinuous (i.e. purely discrete or mixed). '
