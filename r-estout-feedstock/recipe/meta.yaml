  summary: This package is intended to speedup the process of creating model-comparing tables
    common in Macroeconomics. The function collection stores the estimates of several
    models and formats it to a table of the form estimate starred and std.err. below.
    The default output is LaTeX but output to CSV for later editing in a spreadsheet
    tool is possible as well. It works for linear models (lm) and panel models from
    the "plm"-package (plm). Two further implemented functions "descsto" and "desctab"
    enable you to export descriptive statistics of data-frames and single variables
    to LaTeX and CSV.
