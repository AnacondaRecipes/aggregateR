  summary: 'Infers state-recorded gender categories from first names and dates of birth using
    historical datasets. By using these datasets instead of lists of male and female
    names, this package is able to more accurately infer the gender of a name, and it
    is able to report the probability that a name was male or female. GUIDELINES: This
    method must be used cautiously and responsibly. Please be sure to see the guidelines
    and warnings about usage in the ''README'' or the package documentation. See Blevins
