  summary: Contains functions to create regulatory-style statistical reports. Originally designed
    to create tables, listings, and figures for the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and
    medical device industries, these reports are generalized enough that they could
    be used in any industry. Generates text, rich-text, PDF, HTML, and Microsoft Word
    file formats. The package specializes in printing wide and long tables with automatic
    page wrapping and splitting. Reports can be produced with a minimum of function
    calls, and without relying on other table packages.  The package supports titles,
    footnotes, page header, page footers, spanning headers, page by variables, and automatic
    page numbering.
