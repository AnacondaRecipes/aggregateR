  summary: Provides functions for computing the one-sided p-values of the Cochran-Armitage trend
    test statistic for the asymptotic and the exact conditional test. The computation
    of the p-value for the exact test is performed using an algorithm following an idea
    by Mehta, et al. (1992) <doi:10.2307/1390598>.
