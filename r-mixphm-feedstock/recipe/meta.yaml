  summary: Fits multiple variable mixtures of various parametric proportional hazard models using
    the EM-Algorithm. Proportionality restrictions can be imposed on the latent groups
    and/or on the variables. Several survival distributions can be specified. Missing
    values and censored values are allowed. Independence is assumed over the single
    variables.
