  summary: Provides the tools to undertake estimation in Regression Discontinuity Designs. Both
    sharp and fuzzy designs are supported. Estimation is accomplished using local linear
    regression. A provided function will utilize Imbens-Kalyanaraman optimal bandwidth
    calculation. A function is also included to test the assumption of no-sorting effects.
