  summary: Archimax copulas are mixture of Archimedean and EV copulas. The package provides definitions
    of several parametric families of generator and dependence function, computes CDF
    and PDF, estimates parameters, tests for goodness of fit, generates random sample
    and checks copula properties for custom constructs. In 2-dimensional case explicit
    formulas for density are used, contrary to higher dimensions when all derivatives
    are linearly approximated. Several non-archimax families (normal, FGM, Plackett)
    are provided as well.
