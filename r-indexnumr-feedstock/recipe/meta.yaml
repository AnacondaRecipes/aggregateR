  summary: Computes bilateral and multilateral index numbers. It has support for many standard
    bilateral indexes as well as multilateral index number methods such as GEKS, GEKS-Tornqvist
    (or CCDI), Geary-Khamis and the weighted time product dummy (for details on these
    methods see Diewert and Fox (2020) <doi:10.1080/07350015.2020.1816176>). It also
    supports updating of multilateral indexes using several splicing methods.
