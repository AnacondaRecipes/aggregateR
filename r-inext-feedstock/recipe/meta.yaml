  summary: Provides simple functions to compute and plot two types (sample-size- and coverage-based)
    rarefaction and extrapolation curves for species diversity (Hill numbers) based
    on individual-based abundance data or sampling-unit- based incidence data; see Chao
    and others (2014, Ecological Monographs) for pertinent theory and methodologies,
    and Hsieh, Ma and Chao (2016, Methods in Ecology and Evolution) for an introduction
    of the R package.
