  summary: 'Fast randomization based two sample tests. Testing the hypothesis that two samples
    come from the same distribution  using randomization to create p-values. Included
    tests are: Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Kuiper, Cramer-von Mises, and Anderson-Darling. There
    is also a very efficient test based on the Wasserstein Distance. The default test
    ''two_sample'' builds on the  Wasserstein distance by using a weighting scheme like
    that of Anderson-Darling. We also include the permutation scheme to make test building
    simple for others.'
