  summary: Urban water and sanitation survey dataset collected by Water and Sanitation for the
    Urban Poor (WSUP) with technical support from  Valid International. These citywide
    surveys have been collecting data  allowing water and sanitation service levels
    across the entire city to be  characterised, while also allowing more detailed data
    to be collected in  areas of the city of particular interest. These surveys are
    intended to  generate useful information for others working in the water and sanitation
    sector. Current release version includes datasets collected from a survey  conducted
    in Dhaka, Bangladesh in March 2017. This survey in Dhaka is one of  a series of
    surveys to be conducted by WSUP in various cities in which they operate including
    Accra, Ghana; Nakuru, Kenya;  Antananarivo, Madagascar; Maputo, Mozambique; and,
    Lusaka, Zambia. This  package will be updated once the surveys in other cities are
    completed and  datasets have been made available.
