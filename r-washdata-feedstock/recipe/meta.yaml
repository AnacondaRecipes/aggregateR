  summary: Urban water and sanitation survey dataset collected by Water and Sanitation for the
    Urban Poor (WSUP) with technical support from Valid International. These citywide
    surveys have been collecting data allowing water and sanitation service levels across
    the entire city to be characterised, while also allowing more detailed data to be
    collected in areas of the city of particular interest. These surveys are intended
    to generate useful information for others working in the water and sanitation sector.
    Current release version includes datasets collected from a survey conducted in Dhaka,
    Bangladesh in March 2017. This survey in Dhaka is one of a series of surveys to
    be conducted by WSUP in various cities in which they operate including Accra, Ghana;
    Nakuru, Kenya; Antananarivo, Madagascar; Maputo, Mozambique; and, Lusaka, Zambia.
    This package will be updated once the surveys in other cities are completed and
    datasets have been made available.
