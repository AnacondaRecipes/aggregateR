  summary: Implements the efficient algorithm by Ortmann and Brandes (2017) <doi:10.1007/s41109-017-0027-2>
    to compute the orbit-aware frequency distribution of induced and non-induced quads,
    i.e. subgraphs of size four. Given an edge matrix, data frame, or a graph object
    (e.g., 'igraph'), the orbit-aware counts are computed respective each of the edges
    and nodes.
