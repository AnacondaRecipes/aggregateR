  summary: Multivariate Time Series (MTS) is a general package for analyzing multivariate linear
    time series and estimating multivariate volatility models. It also handles factor
    models, constrained factor models, asymptotic principal component analysis commonly
    used in finance and econometrics, and principal volatility component analysis.  (a)
    For the multivariate linear time series analysis, the package performs model specification,
    estimation, model checking, and prediction for many widely used models, including
    vector AR models, vector MA models, vector ARMA models, seasonal vector ARMA models,
    VAR models with exogenous variables, multivariate regression models with time series
    errors, augmented VAR models, and Error-correction VAR models for co-integrated
    time series. For model specification, the package performs structural specification
    to overcome the difficulties of identifiability of VARMA models. The methods used
    for structural specification include Kronecker indices and Scalar Component Models.  (b)
    For multivariate volatility modeling, the MTS package handles several commonly used
    models, including multivariate exponentially weighted moving-average volatility,
    Cholesky decomposition volatility models, dynamic conditional correlation (DCC)
    models, copula-based volatility models, and low-dimensional BEKK models. The package
    also considers multiple tests for conditional heteroscedasticity, including rank-based
    statistics.  (c) Finally, the MTS package also performs forecasting using diffusion
    index , transfer function analysis, Bayesian estimation of VAR models, and multivariate
    time series analysis with missing values.Users can also use the package to simulate
    VARMA models, to compute impulse response functions of a fitted VARMA model, and
    to calculate theoretical cross-covariance matrices of a given VARMA model.
