  summary: Uses a kernel smoothing approach to calculate Mutual Information for comparisons between
    all types of variables including continuous vs continuous, continuous vs discrete
    and discrete vs discrete. Uses a nonparametric bias correction giving Bias Corrected
    Mutual Information (BCMI). Implemented efficiently in Fortran 95 with OpenMP and
    suited to large genomic datasets.
