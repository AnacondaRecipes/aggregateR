  summary: 'Uses a kernel smoothing approach to calculate Mutual Information for comparisons
    between all types of variables including continuous vs continuous, continuous vs
    discrete and discrete vs discrete. Uses a nonparametric bias correction giving Bias
    Corrected Mutual Information (BCMI). Implemented efficiently in Fortran 95 with
    OpenMP and suited to large genomic datasets.  '
