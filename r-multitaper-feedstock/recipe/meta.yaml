  summary: 'Implements multitaper spectral analysis using discrete prolate spheroidal sequences
    (Slepians) and sine tapers. It includes an adaptive weighted multitaper spectral
    estimate, a coherence estimate, Thomson''s Harmonic F-test, and complex demodulation.
    The Slepians sequences are generated efficiently using a tridiagonal matrix solution,
    and jackknifed confidence intervals are available for most estimates.   '
