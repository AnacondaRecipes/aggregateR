  summary: Implements multitaper spectral analysis using discrete prolate spheroidal sequences
    (Slepians) and sine tapers. It includes an adaptive weighted multitaper spectral
    estimate, a coherence estimate, Thomson's Harmonic F-test, and complex demodulation.
    The Slepians sequences are generated efficiently using a tridiagonal matrix solution,
    and jackknifed confidence intervals are available for most estimates. This package
    is an implementation of the method described in D.J. Thomson (1982) "Spectrum estimation
    and harmonic analysis" <doi:10.1109/PROC.1982.12433>.
