  summary: We provide a toolbox to estimate the time delay between the brightness time series
    of gravitationally lensed quasar images via Bayesian and profile likelihood approaches.
    The model is based on a state-space representation for  irregularly observed time
    series data generated from a latent continuous-time Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.
    Our Bayesian method adopts scientifically motivated hyper-prior distributions and
    a Metropolis-Hastings within Gibbs sampler, producing posterior samples of the model
    parameters that include the time delay. A profile likelihood of the time delay is
    a simple approximation to the marginal posterior distribution of the time delay.
    Both Bayesian and profile likelihood approaches complement each other, producing
    almost identical results; the Bayesian way is more principled but the profile likelihood
    is easier to implement. A new functionality is added in version 1.0.9 for estimating
    the time delay between doubly-lensed light curves observed in two bands. See also
