  summary: For studying recurrent disease and death with competing risks, comparisons based on
    the well-known cumulative incidence function can be confounded by different prevalence
    rates of the competing events. Alternatively, comparisons of the conditional distribution
    of the survival time given the failure event type are more relevant for investigating
    the prognosis of different patterns of recurrence disease. This package implements
    a nonparametric estimator for the conditional cumulative incidence function and
    a nonparametric conditional bivariate cumulative incidence function for the bivariate
    gap times proposed in Huang et al. (2016) <doi:10.1111/biom.12494>.
