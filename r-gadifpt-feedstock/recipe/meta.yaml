  summary: 'In this package we consider Gaussian Diffusion processes and smooth thresholds. After
    evaluating the mean of the process to check the subthreshold regimen hypothesis,
    the FPT density function is reconstructed via the numerical quadrature of the integral
    equation in (Buonocore 1987); first passage times are also generated by the method
    in (Buonocore 2014) and results are compared. The timestep of the simulations can
    iteratively be refined. User should provide the functional form for the drift and
    the infinitesimal variance in the script ''userfunc.R'' and for the threshold in
    the script ''userthresh.R''. All the parameters required by the implementation are
    to be set in the script ''userparam.R''. Example scripts for common drifts and thresholds
    are given. '
