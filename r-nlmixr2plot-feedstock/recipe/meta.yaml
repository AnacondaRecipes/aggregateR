  summary: Fit and compare nonlinear mixed-effects models in differential equations with flexible
    dosing information commonly seen in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (Almquist,
    Leander, and Jirstrand 2015 <doi:10.1007/s10928-015-9409-1>). Differential equation
    solving is by compiled C code provided in the 'rxode2' package (Wang, Hallow, and
    James 2015 <doi:10.1002/psp4.12052>). This package is for 'ggplot2' plotting methods
    for 'nlmixr2' objects.
