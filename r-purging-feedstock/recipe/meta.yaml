  summary: Simple method of purging independent variables of mediating effects. First, regress
    the direct variable on the indirect variable. Then, used the stored residuals as
    the new purged (direct) variable in the updated specification. This purging process
    allows for use of a new direct variable uncorrelated with the indirect variable.
