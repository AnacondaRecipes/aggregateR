  summary: Three most common types of stepwise regression including linear regression, logistic
    regression and cox proportional hazard regression can be performed to select best
    model with methods of forward selection, backward elimination, bidirectional selection
    and best subset selection. A widely used selection criteria are available for variable
    selection.
