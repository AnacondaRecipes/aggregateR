  summary: Stepwise regression analysis for variable selection can be used to get the best candidate
    final regression model in univariate or multivariate regression analysis with the
    'forward' and 'stepwise' steps. Procedure can use Akaike information criterion,
    corrected Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, Hannan and
    Quinn information criterion, corrected Hannan and Quinn information criterion, Schwarz
    criterion and significance levels as selection criteria. Multicollinearity detection
    in regression model are performed by checking tolerance value. Continuous variables
    nested within class effect and weighted stepwise regression are also considered
    in this package.
