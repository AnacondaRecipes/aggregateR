  summary: Computes A-, MV-, D- and E-optimal or near-optimal block designs for two-colour cDNA
    microarray experiments using the linear fixed effects and mixed effects models where
    the interest is in a comparison of all possible elementary treatment contrasts.
    The algorithms used in this package are based on the treatment exchange and array
    exchange algorithms of Debusho, Gemechu and Haines (2016, unpublished). The package
    also provides an optional method of using the graphical user interface (GUI) R package
    tcltk to ensure that it is user friendly.
