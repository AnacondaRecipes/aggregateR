  summary: Likelihood-based approaches to estimate linear regression parameters and treatment
    effects in the presence of endogeneity. Specifically, this package includes James
    Heckman's classical simultaneous equation models-the sample selection model for
    outcome selection bias and hybrid model with structural shift for endogenous treatment.
    For more information, see the seminal paper of Heckman (1978) <DOI:10.3386/w0177>
    in which the details of these models are provided. This package accommodates repeated
    measures on subjects with a working independence approach. The hybrid model further
    accommodates treatment effect modification.
