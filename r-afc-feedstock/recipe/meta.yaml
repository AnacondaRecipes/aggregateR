  summary: 'This is an implementation of the Generalized Discrimination Score (also known as
    Two Alternatives Forced Choice Score, 2AFC) for various  representations of forecasts
    and verifying observations. The Generalized  Discrimination Score is a generic forecast
    verification framework which  can be applied to any of the following verification
    contexts: dichotomous,  polychotomous (ordinal and nominal), continuous, probabilistic,
    and ensemble. A comprehensive description of the Generalized Discrimination Score,
    including  all equations used in this package, is provided by Mason and Weigel (2009)  <doi:10.1175/MWR-D-10-05069.1>.'
