  summary: 'The function ''install_load'' checks the local R library(ies) to see if the required
    package(s) is/are installed or not. If the package(s) is/are not installed, then
    the package(s) will be installed along with the required dependency(ies). This function
    pulls source or binary packages from the Posit/RStudio-sponsored CRAN mirror. Lastly,
    the chosen package(s) is/are loaded. The function ''load_package'' simply loads
    the provided package(s). If this package does not fit your needs, then you may want
    to consider these other R packages: ''needs'', ''easypackages'', ''pacman'', ''pak'',
    ''anyLib'', and/or ''librarian''.'
