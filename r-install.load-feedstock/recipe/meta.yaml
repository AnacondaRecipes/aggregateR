  summary: The function `install_load` checks the local R library(ies) to see if the required
    package(s) is/are installed or not. If the package(s) is/are not installed, then
    the package(s) will be installed along with the required dependency(ies). This function
    pulls source or binary packages from the Rstudio-sponsored CRAN mirror and/or the
    USGS GRAN Repository. Lastly, the chosen package(s) is/are loaded. The function
    `load_package` simply loads the provided packages.
