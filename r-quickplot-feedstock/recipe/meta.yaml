  summary: A high-level plotting system, compatible with `ggplot2` objects, maps from `sf`, `terra`,
    `raster`, `sp`. It is built primarily on the 'grid' package. The objective of the
    package is to provide a plotting system that is built for speed and modularity.
    This is useful for quick visualizations when testing code and for plotting multiple
    figures to the same device from independent sources that may be independent of one
    another (i.e., different function or modules the create the visualizations).  The
    suggested package 'fastshp' can be installed from the repository (<https://PredictiveEcology.r-universe.dev>).
