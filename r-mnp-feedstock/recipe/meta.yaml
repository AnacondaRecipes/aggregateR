  summary: 'Fits the Bayesian multinomial probit model via Markov chain Monte Carlo.  The multinomial
    probit model is often used to analyze the discrete choices made by individuals recorded
    in survey data. Examples where the multinomial probit model may be useful include
    the analysis of product choice by consumers in market research and the analysis
    of candidate or party choice by voters in electoral studies. The MNP package can
    also fit the model with different choice sets for each individual, and complete
    or partial individual choice orderings of the available alternatives from the choice
    set. The estimation is based on the efficient marginal data augmentation algorithm
