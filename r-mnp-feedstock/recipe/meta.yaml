  summary: 'Fits the Bayesian multinomial probit model via Markov chain Monte Carlo.  The multinomial
    probit model is often used to analyze  the discrete choices made by individuals
    recorded in survey data.  Examples where the multinomial probit model may be useful
    include the  analysis of product choice by consumers in market research and the  analysis
    of candidate or party choice by voters in electoral studies.   The MNP package can
    also fit the model with different choice sets for  each individual, and complete
    or partial individual choice orderings  of the available alternatives from the choice
    set. The estimation is based on the efficient marginal data augmentation algorithm
