  summary: A collection of matrix functions for teaching and learning matrix linear algebra as
    used in multivariate statistical methods. These functions are mainly for tutorial
    purposes in learning matrix algebra ideas using R. In some cases, functions are
    provided for concepts available elsewhere in R, but where the function call or name
    is not obvious. In other cases, functions are provided to show or demonstrate an
    algorithm. In addition, a collection of functions are provided for drawing vector
    diagrams in 2D and 3D.
