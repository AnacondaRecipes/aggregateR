  summary: Contains a function to categorize accelerometer readings collected in free-living
    (e.g., for 24 hours/day for 7 days), preprocessed and compressed as counts (unit-less
    value) in a specified time period termed epoch (e.g., 1 minute) as either bedrest
    (sleep) or active.  The input is a matrix with a timestamp column and a column with
    number of counts per epoch. The output is the same dataframe with an additional
    column termed bedrest. In the bedrest column each line (epoch) contains a function-generated
    classification 'br' or 'a' denoting bedrest/sleep and activity, respectively.  The
    package is designed to be used after wear/nonwear marking function in the 'PhysicalActivity'
    package.  Version 1.1 adds preschool thresholds and corrects for possible errors
    in algorithm implementation.
