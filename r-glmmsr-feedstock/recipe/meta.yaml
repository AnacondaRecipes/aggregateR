  summary: Conduct inference about generalized linear mixed models, with a choice about which
    method to use to approximate the likelihood. In addition to the Laplace and adaptive
    Gaussian quadrature approximations, which are borrowed from 'lme4', the likelihood
    may be approximated by the sequential reduction approximation, or an importance
    sampling approximation. These methods provide an accurate approximation to the likelihood
    in some situations where it is not possible to use adaptive Gaussian quadrature.
