  summary: Implements the covariate balancing propensity score (CBPS) proposed by Imai and Ratkovic
    (2014) <DOI:10.1111/rssb.12027>. The propensity score is estimated such that it
    maximizes the resulting covariate balance as well as the prediction of treatment
    assignment. The method, therefore, avoids an iteration between model fitting and
    balance checking.  The package also implements optimal CBPS from Fan et al. (in-press)
    <DOI:10.1080/07350015.2021.2002159>, several extensions of the CBPS beyond the cross-sectional,
    binary treatment setting. They include the CBPS for longitudinal settings so that
    it can be used in conjunction with marginal structural models from Imai and Ratkovic
    (2015) <DOI:10.1080/01621459.2014.956872>, treatments with three- and four-valued
    treatment variables, continuous-valued treatments from Fong, Hazlett, and Imai (2018)
    <DOI:10.1214/17-AOAS1101>, propensity score estimation with a large number of covariates
    from Ning, Peng, and Imai (2020) <DOI:10.1093/biomet/asaa020>, and the situation
    with multiple distinct binary treatments administered simultaneously. In the future
    it will be extended to other settings including the generalization of experimental
    and instrumental variable estimates.
