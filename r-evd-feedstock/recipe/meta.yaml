  summary: Extends simulation, distribution, quantile and density functions to univariate and
    multivariate parametric extreme value distributions, and provides fitting functions
    which calculate maximum likelihood estimates for univariate and bivariate maxima
    models, and for univariate and bivariate threshold models.
