  summary: Allows caching of raw data directly in R code. This allows R scripts and R Notebooks
    to be shared and re-run on a machine without access to the original data. Cached
    data is encoded into an ASCII string that can be pasted into R code. When the code
    is run, the data is automatically loaded from the cached version if the original
    data file is unavailable. Works best for small datasets (a few hundred observations).
