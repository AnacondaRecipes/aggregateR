  summary: The 'ggplot2' package provides simple functions for visualizing contours of 2-d kernel
    density estimates. 'ggdensity' implements several additional density estimators
    as well as more interpretable visualizations based on highest density regions instead
    of the traditional height of the estimated density surface.
