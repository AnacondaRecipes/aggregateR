  summary: 'Fit linear mixed-effects models using restricted (or residual) maximum likelihood
    (REML) and with generalized inverse matrices to specify covariance structures for
    random effects. In particular, the package is suited to fit quantitative genetic
    mixed models, often referred to as ''animal models''  (Kruuk. 2004 <DOI: 10.1098/rstb.2003.1437>).
    Implements the average information algorithm as the main tool to maximize the restricted
    likelihood, but with other algorithms available (Meyer. 1997. Genet Sel Evol 29:97;
