  summary: The four functions svdcp (cp for column partitioned), svdbip or svdbip2 (bip for bi-partitioned),
    and svdbips (s for a simultaneous optimization of one set of r solutions), correspond
    to a "SVD by blocks" notion, by supposing each block depending on relative subspaces,
    rather than on two whole spaces as usual SVD does. The other functions, based on
    this notion, are relative to two column partitioned data matrices x and y defining
    two sets of subsets xi and yj of variables and amount to estimate a link between
    xi and yj for the pair (xi, yj) relatively to the links associated to all the other
    pairs.
