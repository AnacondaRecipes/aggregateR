  summary: Performs 'classical' age-depth modelling of dated sediment deposits - prior to applying
    more sophisticated techniques such as Bayesian age-depth modelling. Any radiocarbon
    dated depths are calibrated. Age-depth models are constructed by sampling repeatedly
    from the dated levels, each time drawing age-depth curves. Model types include linear
    interpolation, linear or polynomial regression, and a range of splines. See Blaauw
    (2010). <doi:10.1016/j.quageo.2010.01.002>.
