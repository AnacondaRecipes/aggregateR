  summary: Contains routines for logspline density estimation. The function oldlogspline() uses
    the same algorithm as the logspline package version 1.0.x; i.e. the Kooperberg and
    Stone (1992)  algorithm (with an improved interface).  The recommended routine logspline()
    uses an algorithm from Stone et al (1997)  <DOI:10.1214/aos/1031594728>.
