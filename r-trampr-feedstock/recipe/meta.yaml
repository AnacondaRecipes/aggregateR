  summary: Matching terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism ('TRFLP') profiles between
    unknown samples and a database of known samples.  TRAMPR facilitates analysis of
    many unknown profiles at once, and provides tools for working directly with electrophoresis
    output through to generating summaries suitable for community analyses with R's
    rich set of statistical functions.  TRAMPR also resolves the issues of multiple
    'TRFLP' profiles within a species, and shared 'TRFLP' profiles across species.
