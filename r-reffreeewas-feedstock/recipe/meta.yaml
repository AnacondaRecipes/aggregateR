  summary: ' Reference-free method for conducting EWAS while deconvoluting DNA methylation  arising
    as mixtures of cell types.  The older method  (Houseman et al., 2014,<doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btu029>)
    is similar to  surrogate variable analysis (SVA and ISVA), except that it makes
    additional use  of a biological mixture assumption. The newer method (Houseman et
    al., 2016, <doi:10.1186/s12859-016-1140-4>) is similar  to non-negative matrix factorization,
    with additional constraints  and additional utilities.'
