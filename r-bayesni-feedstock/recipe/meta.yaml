  summary: A Bayesian testing procedure for noninferiority trials with binary endpoints. The
    prior is constructed based on Bernstein polynomials with options for both informative
    and non-informative prior. The critical value of the test statistic (Bayes factor)
    is determined by minimizing total weighted error (TWE) criteria
