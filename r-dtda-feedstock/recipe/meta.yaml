  summary: Implementation of different algorithms for analyzing randomly truncated data, one-sided
    and two-sided (i.e. doubly) truncated data. It serves to compute empirical cumulative
    distributions and also kernel density and hazard functions using different bandwidth
    selectors. Several real data sets are included.
