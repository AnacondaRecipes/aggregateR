  summary: 'Implementation of the Open Perimetry Interface (OPI) for simulating and controlling
    visual field machines using R. The OPI is a standard for interfacing with visual
    field testing machines (perimeters) first started as an open source project with
    support of Haag-Streit in 2010. It specifies basic functions that allow many visual
    field tests to be constructed. As of February 2022 it is fully implemented on the
    Haag-Streit Octopus 900 with partial implementations on the Centervue Compass, Kowa
    AP 7000, Android phones and the CrewT IMO. It also has a cousin: the R package ''visualFields'',
    which has tools for analysing and manipulating visual field data.'
