  summary: 'Two one-sided tests (TOST) procedure to test equivalence for t-tests, correlations,
    differences between proportions, and meta-analyses, including power analysis for
    t-tests and correlations. Allows you to specify equivalence bounds in raw scale
    units or in terms of effect sizes. See: Lakens (2017) <doi:10.1177/1948550617697177>.'
