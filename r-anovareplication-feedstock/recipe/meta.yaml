  summary: 'Allows for the computation of a prior predictive p-value to test replication of relevant
    features of original ANOVA studies. Relevant features are captured in informative
    hypotheses. The package also allows for the computation of sample sizes for new
    studies, post-hoc power calculations, and comes with a Shiny application in which
    all calculations can be conducted as well. The statistical underpinnings are described
    in Zondervan-Zwijnenburg (2019) <doi:10.31234/osf.io/6myqh>. '
