  summary: An implementation of permutation tests in R, supporting both exact and asymptotic
    K sample test of data locations. The p value of exact tests is found using tree
    algorithms. Tree algorithms treat permutations of input data as tree nodes and perform
    constraint depth-first searches for permutations that fall into the critical region
    of a test systematically. Pruning of tree search and optimisations at C level enable
    exact tests for certain large data sets.
