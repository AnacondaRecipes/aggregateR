  summary: An implementation of the GroupRemMap penalty for fitting regularized multivariate
    response regression models under the high-dimension-low-sample-size setting. When
    the predictors naturally fall into groups, the GroupRemMap penalty encourages procedure
    to select groups of predictors, while control for the overall sparsity of the final
    model.
