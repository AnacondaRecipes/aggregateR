  summary: Produces heat maps, contour plots, bar plots (in 3D) and surface plots (also, in 3D).
    Is designed for plotting functions of two variables, however, can plot relatively
    arbitrary matrices. Uses HCL color space, extensively. Also, supports triangular
    plots and nested matrices.
