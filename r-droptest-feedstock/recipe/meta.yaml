  summary: Generates simulated data representing the LOX drop testing process (also known as
    impact testing). A simulated process allows for accelerated study of test behavior.
    Functions are provided to simulate trials, test series, and groups of test series.
    Functions for creating plots specific to this process are also included. Test attributes
    and criteria can be set arbitrarily. This work is not endorsed by or affiliated
