  summary: Node centrality measures for temporal networks. Available measures are temporal degree
    centrality, temporal closeness centrality and temporal betweenness centrality defined
    by Kim and Anderson (2012) <doi:10.1103/PhysRevE.85.026107>. Applying the REN algorithm
    by Hanke and Foraita (2017) <doi:10.1186/s12859-017-1677-x> when calculating the
    centrality measures keeps the computational running time linear in the number of
    graph snapshots. Further, all methods can run in parallel up to the number of nodes
    in the network.
