  summary: An implementation of a stochastic heuristic method for performing multidimensional
    function optimization. The method is inspired in the Cross-Entropy Method. It does
    not relies on derivatives, neither imposes particularly strong requirements into
    the function to be optimized. Additionally, it takes profit from multi-core processing
    to enable optimization of time-consuming functions.
