  summary: Provides a set of functions to efficiently recognize and clean the continuous dorsal
    pattern of a female brown anole lizard (Anolis sagrei) traced from 'ImageJ', an
    open platform for scientific image analysis (see <https://imagej.net> for more information),
    and extract common features such as the pattern sinuosity indices, coefficient of
    variation, and max-min width.
