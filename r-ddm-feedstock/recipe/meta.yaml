  summary: A set of three two-census methods to the estimate the degree of death registration
    coverage for a population. Implemented methods include the Generalized Growth Balance
    method (GGB), the Synthetic Extinct Generation method (SEG), and a hybrid of the
    two, GGB-SEG. Each method offers automatic estimation, but users may also specify
    exact parameters or use a graphical interface to guess parameters in the traditional
    way if desired.
