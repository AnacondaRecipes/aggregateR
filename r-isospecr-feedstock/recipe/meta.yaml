  summary: IsoSpec is a fine structure calculator used for obtaining the most probable masses
    of a chemical compound given the frequencies of the composing isotopes and their
    masses. It finds the smallest set of isotopologues with a given probability. The
    probability is assumed to be that of the product of multinomial distributions, each
    corresponding to one particular element and parametrized by the frequencies of finding
    these elements in nature. These numbers are supplied by IUPAC - the International
    Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry.
