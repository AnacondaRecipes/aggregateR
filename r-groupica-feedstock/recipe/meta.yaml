  summary: Contains an implementation of an independent component analysis (ICA) for grouped
    data. The main function groupICA() performs a blind source separation, by maximizing
    an independence across sources and allows to adjust for varying confounding for
    user-specified groups. Additionally, the package contains the function uwedge()
    which can be used to approximately jointly diagonalize a list of matrices. For more
    details see the project website <https://sweichwald.de/groupICA/>.
