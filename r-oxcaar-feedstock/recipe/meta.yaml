  summary: A set of tools that enables using 'OxCal' from within R. 'OxCal' (<https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal.html>)
    is a standard archaeological tool intended to provide 14C calibration and analysis
    of archaeological and environmental chronological information. 'OxcAAR' allows simple
    calibration with 'Oxcal' and plotting of the results as well as the execution of
    sophisticated ('OxCal') code and the import of the results of bulk analysis and
    complex Bayesian sequential calibration.
