  summary: Computes the required sample size using the optimal designs with multiple constraints
    proposed in Mayo et al.(2010). This optimal method is designed for two-arm, randomized
    phase II clinical trials, and the required sample size can be optimized either using
    fixed or flexible randomization allocation ratios.
