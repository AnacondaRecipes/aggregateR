  summary: Robust nonparametric bootstrap and permutation tests for location, correlation, and
    regression problems, as described in Helwig (2019a) <doi:10.1002/wics.1457> and
    Helwig (2019b) <doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116030>. Univariate and multivariate
    tests are supported. For each problem, exact tests and Monte Carlo approximations
    are available. Five different nonparametric bootstrap confidence intervals are implemented.
    Parallel computing is implemented via the 'parallel' package.
