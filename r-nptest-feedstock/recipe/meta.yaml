  summary: Robust permutation tests for location, correlation, and regression problems, as described
    in Helwig (2019) <doi:10.1002/wics.1457>. Univariate and multivariate tests are
    supported. For each problem, exact tests and Monte Carlo approximations are available.
    Parallel computing is implemented via the 'parallel' package.
