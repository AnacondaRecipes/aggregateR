  summary: BayesValidate implements the software validation method described in the paper "Validation
    of Software for Bayesian Models using Posterior Quantiles" (Cook, Gelman, and Rubin,
    2005).  It inputs a function to perform Bayesian inference as well as functions
    to generate data from the Bayesian model being fit, and repeatedly generates and
    analyzes data to check that the Bayesian inference program works properly.
