  summary: Tools for randomization-based inference. Current focus is on the d^2 omnibus test
    of differences of means following Hansen and Bowers (2008)  <doi:10.1214/08-STS254>
    . This test is useful for assessing balance in matched observational studies or
    for analysis of outcomes in block-randomized experiments.
