  summary: 'Simple interpolation methods designed to be used from C code. Supports constant,
    linear and spline interpolation. An R wrapper is included but this package is primarily
    designed to be used from C code using ''LinkingTo''.  The spline calculations are
    classical cubic interpolation, e.g., Forsythe, Malcolm and Moler (1977) <ISBN: 9780131653320>.'
