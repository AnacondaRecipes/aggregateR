  summary: 'Objects to manipulate sequential and seasonal time series. Sequential time series
    based on time instants and time durations are handled. Both can be regularly or
    unevenly spaced (overlapping durations are allowed). Only POSIX* format are used
    for dates and times. The following classes are provided : ''POSIXcti'', ''POSIXctp'',
    ''TimeIntervalDataFrame'', ''TimeInstantDataFrame'', ''SubtimeDataFrame'' ; methods
    to switch from a class to another and to modify the time support of series (hourly
    time series to daily time series for instance) are also defined. Tools provided
    can be used for instance to handle environmental monitoring data (not always produced
    on a regular time base).'
