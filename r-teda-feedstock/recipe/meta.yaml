  summary: The typicality and eccentricity data analysis (TEDA) framework was put forward by
    Angelov (2013) <DOI:10.14313/JAMRIS_2-2014/16>. It has been further developed into
    multiple different techniques since, and provides a non-parametric way of determining
    how similar an observation, from a process that is not purely random, is to other
    observations generated by the process. This package provides code to use the batch
    and recursive TEDA methods that have been published.
