  summary: A powerful yet simple graphical tool available in the field of psychometrics is the
    Wright Map (also known as item maps or item-person maps), which presents the location
    of both respondents and items on the same scale. Wright Maps are commonly used to
    present the results of dichotomous or polytomous item response models. The 'WrightMap'
    package provides functions to create these plots from item parameters and person
    estimates stored as R objects. Although the package can be used in conjunction with
    any software used to estimate the IRT model (e.g. 'TAM', 'mirt', 'eRm' or 'IRToys'
    in 'R', or 'Stata', 'Mplus', etc.),  'WrightMap' features special integration with
    'ConQuest' to facilitate reading and plotting its output directly.The 'wrightMap'
    function creates Wright Maps based on person estimates and item parameters produced
    by an item response analysis. The 'CQmodel' function reads output files created
    using 'ConQuest' software and creates a set of data frames for easy data manipulation,
    bundled in a 'CQmodel' object. The 'wrightMap' function can take a 'CQmodel' object
    as input or it can be used to create Wright Maps directly from data frames of person
    and item parameters.
