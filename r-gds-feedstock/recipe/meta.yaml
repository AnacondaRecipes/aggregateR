  summary: Contains a function called gds() which accepts three input parameters like lower limits,
    upper limits and the frequencies of the corresponding classes. The gds() function
    calculate and return the values of mean ('gmean'), median ('gmedian'), mode ('gmode'),
    variance ('gvar'), standard deviation ('gstdev'), coefficient of variance ('gcv'),
    quartiles ('gq1', 'gq2', 'gq3'), inter-quartile range ('gIQR'), skewness ('g1'),
    and kurtosis ('g2') which facilitate effective data analysis. For skewness and kurtosis
    calculations we use moments.
