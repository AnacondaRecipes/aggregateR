  summary: 'Provides a collection of utilities that allow programming with  R''s operators. Routines
    allow classifying operators,  translating to and from an operator and its underlying
    function, and inverting  some operators (e.g. comparison operators), etc. All methods
    can be extended to custom infix operators. '
