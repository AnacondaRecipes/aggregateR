  summary: An implementation of a specific method for generating n-dimensional random vectors
    with given marginal distributions and correlation matrix. The method uses the NORTA
    (NORmal To Anything) approach which generates a standard normal random vector and
    then transforms it into a random vector with specified marginal distributions and
    the RA (Retrospective Approximation) algorithm which is a generic stochastic root-finding
    algorithm. The marginals can be continuous or discrete. See the vignette of package
    for more details.
