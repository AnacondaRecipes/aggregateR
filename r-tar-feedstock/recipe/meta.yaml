  summary: 'Identification and estimation of the autoregressive threshold models with Gaussian
    noise, as well as positive-valued time series. The package provides the identification
    of the number of regimes, the thresholds and the autoregressive orders, as well
    as the estimation of remain parameters. The package implements the methodology from
    the 2005 paper: Modeling Bivariate Threshold Autoregressive Processes in the Presence
    of Missing Data <DOI:10.1081/STA-200054435>.'
