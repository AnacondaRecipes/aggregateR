  summary: A compilation of fish stock assessment methods for the analysis of length-frequency
    data in the context of data-poor fisheries. Includes methods and examples included
    in the FAO Manual by P. Sparre and S.C. Venema (1998), "Introduction to tropical
    fish stock assessment" (<http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/9bb12a06-2f05-5dcb-a6ca-2d6dd3080f65/>),
    as well as other more recent methods.
