  summary: A port of the web-based software 'DAGitty', available at <http://dagitty.net>, for
    analyzing structural causal models (also known as directed acyclic graphs or DAGs).
    This package computes covariate adjustment sets for estimating causal effects, enumerates
    instrumental variables, derives testable implications (d-separation and vanishing
    tetrads), generates equivalent models, and includes a simple facility for data simulation.
