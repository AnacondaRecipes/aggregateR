  summary: Real probability distributions can be represented as the square of an orthogonal sum
    in the Hermite basis. This representation is formally similar to the representation
    of quantum mechanical states as wave functions, whose squared modulus is a probability
    density. This is described in more detail in "Wave function representation of probability
    distributions," by Madeleine B. Thompson <arXiv:1712.07764>. This package provides
    a reference implementation of the technique.
