  summary: A function setVectorSeed() is provided. Its argument is a numeric vector of an arbitrary
    nonzero length, whose components have integer values from [0, 2^32-1]. The input
    vector is transformed using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm into an
    initial state of Mersenne-Twister random number generator. The function provides
    a better alternative to the R base function set.seed(), if the input vector is a
    single integer. Initializing a stream of random numbers with a vector is a convenient
    way to obtain several streams, each of which is identified by several integer indices.
