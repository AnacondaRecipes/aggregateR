  summary: The utility of this package is in simulating mixtures of Gaussian distributions with
    different levels of overlap between mixture components.  Pairwise overlap, defined
    as a sum of two misclassification probabilities, measures the degree of interaction
    between components and can be readily employed to control the clustering complexity
    of datasets simulated from mixtures. These datasets can then be used for systematic
    performance investigation of clustering and finite mixture modeling algorithms.
    Among other capabilities of 'MixSim', there are computing the exact overlap for
    Gaussian mixtures, simulating Gaussian and non-Gaussian data, simulating outliers
    and noise variables, calculating various measures of agreement between two partitionings,
    and constructing parallel distribution plots for the graphical display of finite
    mixture models.
