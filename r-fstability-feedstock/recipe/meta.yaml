  summary: 'Has two functions to help with calculating feature selection stability. ''Lump''
    is a function that groups subset vectors into a dataframe, and adds NA to shorter
    vectors so they all have the same length. ''ASM'' is a function that takes a dataframe
    of subset vectors and the original vector of features as inputs, and calculates
    the Stability of the feature selection. The calculation for ''asm'' uses the Adjusted
    Stability Measure proposed in: ''Lustgarten'', ''Gopalakrishnan'', & ''Visweswaran''
