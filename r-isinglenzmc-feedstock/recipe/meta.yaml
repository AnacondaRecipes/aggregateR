  summary: Classical Ising Model is a land mark system in statistical physics.The model explains
    the physics of spin glasses and magnetic materials, and cooperative phenomenon in
    general, for example phase transitions and neural networks.This package provides
    utilities to simulate one dimensional Ising Model with Metropolis and Glauber Monte
    Carlo with single flip dynamics in periodic boundary conditions. Utility functions
    for exact solutions are provided.
