  summary: 'A collection of ''LaTeX'' styles using ''Beamer'' customization for pdf-based presentation
    slides in ''RMarkdown''. At present it contains ''RMarkdown'' adaptations of the
    LaTeX themes ''Metropolis'' (formerly ''mtheme'') theme by Matthias Vogelgesang
    and others (now included in ''TeXLive''), the ''IQSS'' by Ista Zahn (which is included
    here), and the ''Monash'' theme by Rob J Hyndman. Additional (free) fonts may be
    needed: ''Metropolis'' prefers ''Fira'', and ''IQSS'' requires ''Libertinus''.'
