  summary: Sensitivity analysis for multiple outcomes in observational studies.  For instance,
    all linear combinations of several outcomes may be explored using Scheffe projections
    in the comparison() function; see Rosenbaum (2016, Annals of Applied Statistics)
    <doi:10.1214/16-AOAS942>.  Alternatively, attention may focus on a few principal
    components in the principal() function.  The package includes parallel methods for
    individual outcomes, including tests in the senm() function and confidence intervals
    in the senmCI() function.
