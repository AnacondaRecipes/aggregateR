  summary: The software application Praat can be used to annotate waveform data (e.g., to mark
    intervals of interest or to label events). (See <http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/>
    for more information about Praat.) These annotations are stored in a Praat TextGrid
    object, which consists of a number of interval tiers and point tiers. An interval
    tier consists of sequential (i.e., not overlapping) labeled intervals. A point tier
    consists of labeled events that have no duration. The 'textgRid' package provides
    S4 classes, generics, and methods for accessing information that is stored in Praat
    TextGrid objects.
