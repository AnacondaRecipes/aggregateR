  summary: Generate concentration-time profiles from linear pharmacokinetic (PK) systems, possibly
    with first-order absorption or zero-order infusion, possibly with one or more peripheral
    compartments, and possibly under steady-state conditions. Single or multiple doses
    may be specified. Secondary (derived) PK parameters (e.g. Cmax, Ctrough, AUC, Tmax,
    half-life, etc.) are computed.
