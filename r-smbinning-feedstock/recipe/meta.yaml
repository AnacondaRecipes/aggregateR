  summary: A set of functions to build a scoring model from beginning to end, leading the user
    to follow an efficient and organized development process, reducing significantly
    the time spent on data exploration, variable selection, feature engineering, binning
    and model selection among other recurrent tasks. The package also incorporates monotonic
    and customized binning, scaling capabilities that transforms logistic coefficients
    into points for a better business understanding and calculates and visualizes classic
    performance metrics of a classification model.
