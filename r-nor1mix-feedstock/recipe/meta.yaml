  summary: Onedimensional Normal (i.e. Gaussian) Mixture Models Classes, for, e.g., density estimation
    or clustering algorithms research and teaching; providing the widely used Marron-Wand
    densities.  Efficient random number generation and graphics. Fitting to data by
    efficient ML (Maximum Likelihood) or traditional EM estimation.
