  summary: 'The "Vertical and Horizontal Inheritance Consistence Analysis" method is described
    in the following publication: "VHICA: a new method to discriminate between vertical
    and horizontal transposon transfer: application to the mariner family within Drosophila"
    by G. Wallau. et al. (2016) <DOI:10.1093/molbev/msv341>. The purpose of the method
    is to detect horizontal transfers of transposable elements, by contrasting the divergence
    of transposable element sequences with that of regular genes.'
