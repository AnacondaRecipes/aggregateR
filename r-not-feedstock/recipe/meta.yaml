  summary: 'Provides efficient implementation of the Narrowest-Over-Threshold methodology for
    detecting an unknown number of change-points occurring at unknown locations in one-dimensional
    data following ''deterministic signal + noise'' model. Currently implemented scenarios
    are: piecewise-constant signal, piecewise-constant signal with a heavy-tailed noise,
    piecewise-linear signal, piecewise-quadratic signal, piecewise-constant signal and
    with piecewise-constant variance of the noise. For details, see Baranowski, Chen
    and Fryzlewicz (2019) <doi:10.1111/rssb.12322>.'
