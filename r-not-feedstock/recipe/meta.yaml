  summary: 'Provides efficient implementation of the Narrowest-Over-Threshold methodology for
    detecting an unknown number of change-points occurring at unknown locations in one-dimensional
    data following deterministic signal + noise model, see  R. Baranowski, Y. Chen and
    P. Fryzlewicz (2019) <doi:10.1111/rssb.12322>. Currently implemented scenarios are:
    piecewise-constant signal, piecewise-constant signal with a heavy-tailed noise,
    piecewise-linear signal, piecewise-quadratic signal, piecewise-constant signal and
    with piecewise-constant variance of the noise.'
