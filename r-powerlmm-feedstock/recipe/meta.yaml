  summary: Calculate power for the 'time x treatment' effect in two- and three-level multilevel
    longitudinal studies with missing data. Both the third-level factor (e.g. therapists,
    schools, or physicians), and the second-level factor (e.g. subjects), can be assigned
    random slopes. Studies with partially nested designs, unequal cluster sizes, unequal
    allocation to treatment arms, and different dropout patterns per treatment are supported.
    For all designs power can be calculated both analytically and via simulations. The
    analytical calculations extends the method described in Galbraith et al. (2002)
    <doi:10.1016/S0197-2456(02)00205-2>, to three-level models. Additionally, the simulation
    tools provides flexible ways to investigate bias, Type I errors and the consequences
    of model misspecification.
