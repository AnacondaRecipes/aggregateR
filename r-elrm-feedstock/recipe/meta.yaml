  summary: 'Implements a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to approximate  exact conditional
    inference for logistic regression models. Exact  conditional inference is based
    on the distribution of the sufficient  statistics for the parameters of interest
    given the sufficient statistics  for the remaining nuisance parameters. Using model
    formula notation, users  specify a logistic model and model terms of interest for
    exact inference. See Zamar et al. (2007) <doi:10.18637/jss.v021.i03> for more details. '
