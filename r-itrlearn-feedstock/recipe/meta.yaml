  summary: Maximin-projection learning (MPL, Shi, et al., 2018) is implemented for recommending
    a meaningful and reliable individualized treatment regime for future groups of patients
    based on the observed data from different populations with heterogeneity in individualized
    decision making. Q-learning and A-learning are implemented for estimating the groupwise
    contrast function that shares the same marginal treatment effects. The packages
    contains classical Q-learning and A-learning algorithms for a single stage study
    as a byproduct. More functions will be added at later versions.
