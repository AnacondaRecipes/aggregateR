  summary: Functions for working with the scrypt key derivation functions originally described
    by Colin Percival <https://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt/scrypt.pdf> and in Percival and
    Josefsson (2016) <doi:10.17487/RFC7914>. Scrypt is a password-based key derivation
    function created by Colin Percival. The algorithm was specifically designed to make
    it costly to perform large-scale custom hardware attacks by requiring large amounts
    of memory.
