  summary: Bindings to Google's C++ library Compact Language Detector 2 (see <https://github.com/cld2owners/cld2#readme>
    for more information). Probabilistically detects over 80 languages in plain text
    or HTML. For mixed-language input it returns the top three detected languages and
    their approximate proportion of the total classified text bytes (e.g. 80% English
    and 20% French out of 1000 bytes). There is also a 'cld3' package on CRAN which
    uses a neural network model instead.
