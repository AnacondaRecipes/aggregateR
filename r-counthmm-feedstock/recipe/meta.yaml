  summary: "Provides tools for penalized estimation of flexible hidden Markov models for time
    series of counts w/o the need to specify a (parametric) family of distributions.
    These include functions for model fitting, model checking, and state decoding. For
    details, see Adam, T., Langrock, R., and Wei\xDF, C.H. (2019): Penalized Estimation
    of Flexible Hidden Markov Models for Time Series of Counts. <arXiv:1901.03275>."
