  summary: A pre-processor for mrBayes that assimilates sequences, taxonomic information and
    tree constraints as per xxx.  The main functions of interest for most users will
    be pastis_simple, pastis_main and conch. The main analysis is conducted with pastis_simple
    or pastis_main followed by a manual execution of mrBayes (>3.2). The placement of
    taxa not contained in the tree constraint can be investigated using conch.
