  summary: Implements an algorithm for efficient and exact calculation of hypergeometric and
    binomial probabilities using Chebyshev polynomials, while other algorithm use an
    approximation when N is large. A useful applications is also considered in this
    package for the construction of attribute sampling plans which is an important field
    of statistical quality control. The quantile, and the confidence limit for the attribute
    sampling plan are also implemented in this package. The hypergeometric distribution
    can be represented in terms of Chebyshev polynomials. This representation is particularly
    useful in the calculation of exact values of hypergeometric variables.
