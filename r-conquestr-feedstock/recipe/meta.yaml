  summary: ' Extends ''ACER ConQuest'' by allowing R users to call ''ACER ConQuest'' from within
    R.  The user can also access ''ACER ConQuest'' data objects by reading ''ACER ConQuest''
    System Files (generated by the ''ACER ConQuest'' command ''put''). This is of particular
    use to those who are parsing text file output (e.g., ''show'' files) as this is
    not consistent across releases of ''ACER ConQuest''. Requires ''ACER ConQuest''
    version 4.29.3 or later. A demonstration version can be downloaded from <https://shop.acer.edu.au/acer-conquest-4>. '
