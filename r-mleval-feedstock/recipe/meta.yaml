  summary: Straightforward and detailed evaluation of machine learning models. 'MLeval' can produce
    receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, precision-recall (PR) curves, calibration
    curves, and PR gain curves. 'MLeval' accepts a data frame of class probabilities
    and ground truth labels, or, it can automatically interpret the Caret train function
    results from repeated cross validation, then select the best model and analyse the
    results. 'MLeval' produces a range of evaluation metrics with confidence intervals.
