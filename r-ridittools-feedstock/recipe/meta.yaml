  summary: Functions to compute ridit scores of vectors, compute mean ridits and their standard
    errors for vectors compared to a reference vector, as described in Fleiss (1981,
    ISBN:0-471-06428-9), and compute means/SEs for multiple groups in matrices. Data
    can be either counts or proportions. Emphasis is on ridit analysis of ordered categorical
    data such as Likert items and pain-rating scales.
