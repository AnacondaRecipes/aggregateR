  summary: Provides a general toolkit for downloading, managing, analyzing, and presenting data
    from the U.S. Census (<https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html>),
    including SF1 (Decennial short-form), SF3 (Decennial long-form), and the American
    Community Survey (ACS).  Confidence intervals provided with ACS data are converted
    to standard errors to be bundled with estimates in complex acs objects.  Package
    provides new methods to conduct standard operations on acs objects and present/plot
    data in statistically appropriate ways.
