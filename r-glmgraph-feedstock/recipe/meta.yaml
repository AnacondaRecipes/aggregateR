  summary: We propose to use sparse regression model to achieve variable selection while accounting
    for graph-constraints among coefficients. Different linear combination of a sparsity
    penalty(L1) and a smoothness(MCP) penalty has been used, which induces both sparsity
    of the solution and certain smoothness on the linear coefficients.
