  summary: R's default conflict management system gives the most recently loaded package precedence.
    This can make it hard to detect conflicts, particularly when they arise because
    a package update creates ambiguity that did not previously exist. 'conflicted' takes
    a different approach, making every conflict an error and forcing you to choose which
    function to use.
