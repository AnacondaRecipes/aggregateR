  summary: R's default conflict management system gives the most recently loaded package precedence.
    This can make it hard to detect conflicts,  particularly when they arise because
    a package update creates ambiguity that did not previously exist. 'conflicted' takes
    a different approach,  making every conflict an error and forcing you to choose
    which function  to use.
