  summary: Creates the optimal (D, U and I) designs for the accelerated life testing with right
    censoring or interval censoring. It uses generalized  linear model (GLM) approach
    to derive the asymptotic variance-covariance  matrix of regression coefficients.
    The failure time distribution is assumed  to follow Weibull distribution with a
    known shape parameter and log-linear  link functions are used to model the relationship
    between failure time  parameters and stress variables. The acceleration model may
    have multiple  stress factors, although most ALTs involve only two or less stress
    factors.  ALTopt package also provides several plotting functions including contour
    plot, Fraction of Use Space (FUS) plot and Variance Dispersion graphs of Use Space
    (VDUS) plot.
