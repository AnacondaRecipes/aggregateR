  summary: Aggregates a set of trees with the same leaves to create a consensus tree. The trees
    are typically obtained via hierarchical clustering, hence the hclust format is used
    to encode both the aggregated trees and the final consensus tree. The method is
    exact and proven to be O(nqlog(n)), n being the individuals and q being the number
    of trees to aggregate.
