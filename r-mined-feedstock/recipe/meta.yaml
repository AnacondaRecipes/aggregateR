  summary: This is a method (MinED) for mining probability distributions using deterministic
    sampling which is proposed by Joseph, Wang, Gu, Lv, and Tuo (2018). The MinED samples
    can be used for approximating the target distribution. They can be generated from
    a density function that is known only up to a proportionality constant and thus,
    it might find applications in Bayesian computation. Moreover, the MinED samples
    are generated with much fewer evaluations of the density function compared to random
    sampling-based methods such as MCMC and therefore, this method will be especially
    useful when the unnormalized posterior is expensive or time consuming to evaluate.
