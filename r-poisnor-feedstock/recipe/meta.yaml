  summary: Generates multivariate data with count and continuous variables with a pre-specified
    correlation matrix. The count and continuous variables are assumed to have Poisson
    and normal marginals, respectively. The data generation mechanism is a combination
    of the normal to anything principle and a connection between Poisson and normal
    correlations in the mixture. The details of the method are explained in Yahav et
    al. (2012) <DOI:10.1002/asmb.901>.
