  summary: Functions to fit Gaussian linear model by maximising the residual log likelihood where
    the covariance structure can be written as a linear combination of known matrices.  Can
    be used for multivariate models and random effects models.  Easy straight forward
    manner to specify random effects models, including random interactions. Code now
    optimised to use Sherman Morrison Woodbury identities for matrix inversion in random
    effects models. We've added the ability to fit models using any kernel as well as
    a function to return the mean and covariance of random effects conditional on the
    data (best linear unbiased predictors, BLUPs). Clifford and McCullagh (2006) <https://www.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2006-2.pdf>.
