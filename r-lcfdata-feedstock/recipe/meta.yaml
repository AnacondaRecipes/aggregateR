  summary: This package contains (1) event-related brain potential data recorded from 10 participants
    at electrodes Fz, Cz, Pz, and Oz (0--300 ms) in the context of Antoine Tremblay's
    PhD thesis (Tremblay, 2009); (2) ERP amplitudes at electrode Fz restricted to the
    100 to 175 millisecond time window; and (3) plotting data generated from a linear
    mixed-effects model.
