  summary: Function to  identify  haplotypes within QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci). One haplotype
    is a combination of SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) within the QTL. This function
    groups together all individuals of a population with the same haplotype. Each group
    contains individual with the same allele in each SNP, whether or not missing data.
    Thus, haplotyper groups individuals, that to be imputed, have a non-zero probability
    of having the same alleles in the entire sequence of SNP's. Moreover, haplotyper
    calculates such probability from relative frequencies.
