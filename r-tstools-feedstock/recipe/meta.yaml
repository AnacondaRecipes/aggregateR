  summary: 'Plot official statistics'' time series conveniently: automatic legends, highlight
    windows, stacked bar chars with positive and negative contributions, sum-as-line
    option, two y-axes with automatic horizontal grids that fit both axes and other
    popular chart types. ''tstools'' comes with a plethora of defaults to let you plot
    without setting an abundance of parameters first, but gives you the flexibility
    to tweak the defaults. In addition to charts, ''tstools'' provides a super fast,
    ''data.table'' backed time series I/O that allows the user to export / import long
    format, wide format and transposed wide format data to various file types.'
