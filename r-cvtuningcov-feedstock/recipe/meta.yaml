  summary: 'This is a package for selecting tuning parameters based on cross-validation (CV)
    in regularized estimators of large covariance matrices. Four regularized methods
    are implemented: banding, tapering, hard-thresholding and soft-thresholding. Two
    types of matrix norms are applied: Frobenius norm and operator norm. Two types of
    CV are considered: K-fold CV and random CV. Usually K-fold CV use K-1 folds to train
    a model and the rest one fold to validate the model. The reverse version trains
    a model with 1 fold and validates with the rest with K-1 folds. Random CV randomly
    splits the data set to two parts, a training set and a validation set with user-specified
    sizes. '
