  summary: A Davidian curve defines a seminonparametric density, whose shape and flexibility
    can be tuned by easy to estimate parameters. Since a special case of a Davidian
    curve is the standard normal density, Davidian curves can be used for relaxing normality
    assumption in statistical applications (Zhang & Davidian, 2001) <doi:10.1111/j.0006-341X.2001.00795.x>.
    This package provides the density function, the gradient of the loglikelihood and
    a random generator for Davidian curves.
