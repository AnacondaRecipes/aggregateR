  summary: When security risks in web services are discovered by independent security researchers
    who understand the severity of the risk, they often lack the channels to properly
    disclose them. As a result, security issues may be left unreported. The 'security.txt'
    'Web Security Policies' specification defines an 'IETF' draft standard <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-foudil-securitytxt-00>
    to help organizations define the process for security researchers to securely  disclose
    security vulnerabilities. Tools are provided to help identify and  parse 'security.txt'
    files to enable analysis of the usage and adoption of these policies.
