  summary: An implementation of the bridge distribution with logit-link in R. In Wang and Louis
    (2003) <DOI:10.1093/biomet/90.4.765>, such a univariate bridge distribution was
    derived as the distribution of the random intercept that 'bridged' a marginal logistic
    regression and a conditional logistic regression. The conditional and marginal regression
    coefficients are a scalar multiple of each other. Such is not the case if the random
    intercept distribution was Gaussian.
