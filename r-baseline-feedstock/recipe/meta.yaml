  summary: Collection of baseline correction algorithms, along with a framework and a GUI for
    optimising baseline algorithm parameters. Typical use of the package is for removing
    background effects from spectra originating from various types of spectroscopy and
    spectrometry, possibly optimizing this with regard to regression or classification
    results. Correction methods include polynomial fitting, weighted local smoothers
    and many more.
