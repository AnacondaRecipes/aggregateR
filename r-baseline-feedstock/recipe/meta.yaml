  summary: Collection of baseline correction algorithms, along with a framework and a Tcl/Tk
    enabled GUI for optimising baseline algorithm parameters. Typical use of the package
    is for removing background effects from spectra originating from various types of
    spectroscopy and spectrometry, possibly optimizing this with regard to regression
    or classification results. Correction methods include polynomial fitting, weighted
    local smoothers and many more.
