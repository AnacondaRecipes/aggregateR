  summary: Fits non-crossing regression quantiles as a function of linear covariates and multiple
    smooth terms, including varying coefficients, via B-splines with L1-norm difference
    penalties. The smoothing parameters are estimated as part of the model fitting,
    see Muggeo and others (2021) <doi:10.1177/1471082X20929802>. Monotonicity and concavity
    constraints on the fitted curves are allowed, see Muggeo and others (2013) <doi:10.1007/s10651-012-0232-1>
    and also <doi:10.13140/RG.2.2.12924.85122> for some code examples.
