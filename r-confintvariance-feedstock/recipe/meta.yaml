  summary: Surrounds the usual sample variance of a univariate numeric sample with a confidence
    interval for the population variance. This has been done so far only under the assumption
    that the underlying distribution is normal. Under the hood, this package implements
    the unique least-variance unbiased estimator of the variance of the sample variance,
    in a formula that is equivalent to estimating kurtosis and square of the population
    variance in an unbiased way and combining them according to the classical formula
    into an estimator of the variance of the sample variance. Both the sample variance
    and the estimator of its variance are U-statistics. By the theory of U-statistic,
    the resulting estimator is unique. See Fuchs, Krautenbacher (2016) <doi:10.1080/15598608.2016.1158675>
    and the references therein for an overview of unbiased estimation of variances of
    U-statistics.
