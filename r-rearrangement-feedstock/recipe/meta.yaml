  summary: The rearrangement operator (Hardy, Littlewood, and Polya 1952) for univariate, bivariate,
    and trivariate point estimates of monotonic functions. The package additionally
    provides a function that creates simultaneous confidence intervals for univariate
    functions and applies the rearrangement operator to these confidence intervals.
