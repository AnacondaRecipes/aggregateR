  summary: ' This package calculates ANSI S3.5-1997 Speech Intelligibility Index (SII), a standard
    method for computing the intelligibility of speech from acoustical measurements
    of speech, noise, and hearing thresholds. This package includes data frames corresponding
    to Tables 1 - 4 in the ANSI standard as well as a function utilizing these tables
    and user-provided hearing threshold and noise level measurements to compute the
    SII score.  The methods implemented here extend the standard computations to allow
    calculation of SII when the measured frequencies do not match those required by
    the standard by applying interpolation to obtain values for the required frequencies
    --  Development of this package was funded by the Center for Bioscience Education
    and Technology (CBET) of the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT).'
