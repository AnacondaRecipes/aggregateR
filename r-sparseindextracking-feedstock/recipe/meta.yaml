  summary: 'Computation of sparse portfolios for financial index tracking, i.e., joint selection
    of a subset of the assets that compose the index and computation of their relative
    weights (capital allocation). The level of sparsity of the portfolios, i.e., the
    number of selected assets, is controlled through a regularization parameter. Different
    tracking measures are available, namely, the empirical tracking error (ETE), downside
    risk (DR), Huber empirical tracking error (HETE), and Huber downside risk (HDR).
    See vignette for a detailed documentation and comparison, with several illustrative
    examples. The package is based on the paper: K. Benidis, Y. Feng, and D. P. Palomar,
    "Sparse Portfolios for High-Dimensional Financial Index Tracking," IEEE Trans. on
    Signal Processing, vol. 66, no. 1, pp. 155-170, Jan. 2018. <doi:10.1109/TSP.2017.2762286>.'
