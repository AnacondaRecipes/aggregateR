  summary: This package allows to calculate the fixation index Gst (Nei, 1973) and the differentiation
    index D (Jost, 2008) pairwise between or averaged over several populations.  P-values,
    stating the significance of differentiation, and 95 percent confidence intervals
    can be estimated using bootstrap resamplings. In the case that more than two populations
    are compared pairwise, the p-values are adjusted by bonferroni correction and in
    several other ways due to the multiple comparison from one data set.
