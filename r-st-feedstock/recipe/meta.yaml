  summary: Implements the "shrinkage t" statistic introduced in Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer (2007)
    <DOI:10.2202/1544-6115.1252> and a shrinkage estimate of the "correlation-adjusted
    t-score" (CAT score) described in Zuber and Strimmer (2009) <DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btp460>.
    It also offers a convenient interface  to a number of other regularized t-statistics
    commonly employed in high-dimensional case-control studies.
