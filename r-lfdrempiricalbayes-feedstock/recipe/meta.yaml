  summary: New empirical Bayes methods aiming at analyzing the association of single nucleotide
    polymorphisms (SNPs) to some particular disease are implemented in this package.
    The package uses local false discovery rate (LFDR) estimates of SNPs within a sample
    population defined as a  "reference class" and discovers if SNPs are associated
    with the corresponding disease. Although SNPs are used throughout this document,
    other biological data such as protein data and other gene data can be used. Karimnezhad,
