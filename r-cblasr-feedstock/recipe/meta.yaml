  summary: Provides the 'cblas.h' header file as C interface to the underlying internal 'BLAS'
    library in R. 'CBLAS' <https://www.netlib.org/blas/cblas.h> is a collection of wrappers
    originally written by Keita Teranishi and provides a C interface to the FORTRAN
    'BLAS' library <https://www.netlib.org/blas/>. Note that as internal 'BLAS' library
    provided by R <https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/include/R_ext/BLAS.h> is used
    and only the double precision / double complex 'BLAS' routines are supported.
