  summary: 'The R package contains different MCMC schemes to estimate the regression coefficients
    of a binomial (or binary) logit model within a Bayesian framework: a data-augmented
    independence MH-sampler, an auxiliary mixture sampler and a hybrid auxiliary mixture
    (HAM) sampler. All sampling procedures are based on algorithms using data augmentation,
    where the regression coefficients are estimated by rewriting the logit model as
    a latent variable model called difference random utility model (dRUM).'
