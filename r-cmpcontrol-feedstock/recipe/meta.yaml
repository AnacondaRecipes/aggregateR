  summary: The main purpose of this package is to juxtapose the different control limits obtained
    by modelling a data set through the COM-Poisson distribution vs. the classical Poisson
    distribution. Accordingly, this package offers the ability to compute the COM-Poisson
    parameter estimates and plot associated Shewhart control charts for a given data
    set.
