  summary: 'Set of functions for sparse matrix algebra. Differences with other sparse matrix
    packages are: (1) we only support (essentially) one sparse matrix format, (2) based
    on transparent and simple structure(s), (3) tailored for MCMC calculations within
    G(M)RF. (4) and it is fast and scalable (with the extension package spam64).'
