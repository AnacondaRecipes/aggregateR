  summary: The OpenMPController package provides a function omp_set_num_threads() to set the
    number of OpenMP threads to be used. This may be useful, for example, when linking
    against a vendor optimised BLAS/LAPACK library (e.g. the AMD Core Math Library),
    since the defaults used by those libraries may not be highly performant.
