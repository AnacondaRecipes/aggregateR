  summary: Unified parallelization framework for multiple back-end, designed for internal package
    and interactive usage.  The main operation is parallel mapping over lists.  Supports
    'local', 'multicore', 'mpi' and 'BatchJobs' mode.  Allows tagging of the parallel
    operation with a level name that can be later selected by the user to switch on
    parallel execution for exactly this operation.
