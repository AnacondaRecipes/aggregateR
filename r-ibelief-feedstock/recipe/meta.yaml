  summary: 'Some basic functions to implement belief functions including: transformation between
    belief functions using the method introduced by Philippe Smets (arXiv:1304.1122
    [cs.AI]), evidence combination, evidence discounting, decision-making, and constructing
    masses. Currently, thirteen combination rules and five decision rules are supported.
    It can also be used to generate different types of random masses when working on
    belief combination and conflict management.'
