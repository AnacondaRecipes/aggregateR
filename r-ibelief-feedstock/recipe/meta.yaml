  summary: 'Some basic functions to implement belief functions including: transformation between
    belief functions using the method introduced by Philippe Smets <arXiv:1304.1122>,
    evidence combination, evidence discounting, decision-making, and constructing masses.
    Currently, thirteen combination rules and six decision rules are supported. It can
    also be used to generate different types of random masses when working on belief
    combination and conflict management.'
