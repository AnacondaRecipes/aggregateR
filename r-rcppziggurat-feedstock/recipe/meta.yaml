  summary: The Ziggurat generator for normally distributed random numbers, originally proposed
    by Marsaglia and Tsang (2000, <doi:10.18637/jss.v005.i08>) has been improved upon
    a few times starting with Leong et al (2005, <doi:10.18637/jss.v012.i07>). This
    package provides an aggregation in order to compare different implementations in
    order to provide an 'faster but good enough' alternative for use with R and C++
    code.
