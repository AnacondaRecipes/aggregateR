  summary: A collection of functions to support matrix calculations for probability, econometric
    and numerical analysis. There are additional functions that are comparable to APL
    functions which are useful for actuarial models such as pension mathematics. This
    package is used for teaching and research purposes at the Department of Finance
    and Risk Engineering, New York University, Polytechnic Institute, Brooklyn, NY 11201.
