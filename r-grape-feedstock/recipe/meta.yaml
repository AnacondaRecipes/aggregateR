  summary: 'Gene-Ranking Analysis of Pathway Expression (GRAPE) is a tool for summarizing the
    consensus behavior of biological pathways in the form of a template, and for quantifying
    the extent to which individual samples deviate from the template. GRAPE templates
    are based only on the relative rankings of the genes within the pathway and can
    be used for classification of tissue types or disease subtypes. GRAPE can be used
    to represent gene-expression samples as vectors of pathway scores, where each pathway
    score indicates the departure from a given collection of reference samples. The
    resulting pathway- space representation can be used as the feature set for various
    applications, including survival analysis and drug-response prediction. Users of
    GRAPE should use the following citation: Klein MI, Stern DF, and Zhao H. GRAPE:
    A pathway template method to characterize tissue-specific functionality from gene
    expression profiles. BMC Bioinformatics, 18:317 (June 2017).'
