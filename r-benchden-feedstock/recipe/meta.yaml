  summary: Full implementation of the 28 distributions introduced as benchmarks for nonparametric
    density estimation by Berlinet and Devroye (1994). Includes densities, cdfs, quantile
    functions and generators for samples as well as additional information on features
    of the densities. Also contains the 4 histogram densities used in Rozenholc/Mildenberger/Gather
    (2010).
