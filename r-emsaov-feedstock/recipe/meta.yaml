  summary: Provides the analysis of variance table including the expected mean squares (EMS)
    for various types of experimental design. When some variables are random effects
    or we use special experimental design such as nested design, repeated-measures design,
    or split-plot design, it is not easy to find the appropriate test, especially denominator
    for F-statistic which depends on EMS.
