  summary: ' Builds both ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) and DET (Detection Error Tradeoff)
    curves from a set of predictors, which are the results of a binary classification
    system. The curves give a general vision of the performance of the classifier, and
    are useful for comparing performance of different systems.'
