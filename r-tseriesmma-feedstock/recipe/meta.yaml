  summary: "Multiscale multifractal analysis (MMA) (Giera\xC5\u201Atowski et al., 2012)<DOI:10.1103/PhysRevE.85.021915>
    is a time series analysis method, designed to describe scaling properties of fluctuations
    within the signal analyzed. The main result of this procedure is the so called Hurst
    surface h(q,s) , which is a dependence of the local Hurst exponent h (fluctuation
    scaling exponent) on the multifractal parameter q and the scale of observation s
    (data window width)."
