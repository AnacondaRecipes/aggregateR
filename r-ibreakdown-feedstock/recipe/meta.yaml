  summary: Model agnostic tool for decomposition of predictions from black boxes. Supports additive
    attributions and attributions with interactions. The Break Down Table shows contributions
    of every variable to a final prediction. The Break Down Plot presents variable contributions
    in a concise graphical way. This package works for classification and regression
    models. It is an extension of the 'breakDown' package (Staniak and Biecek 2018)
    <doi:10.32614/RJ-2018-072>, with new and faster strategies for orderings. It supports
    interactions in explanations and has interactive visuals (implemented with 'D3.js'
    library). The methodology behind is described in the 'iBreakDown' article (Gosiewska
    and Biecek 2019) <arXiv:1903.11420> This package is a part of the 'DrWhy.AI' universe
    (Biecek 2018) <arXiv:1806.08915>.
