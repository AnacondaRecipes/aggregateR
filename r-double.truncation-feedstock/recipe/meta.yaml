  summary: Likelihood-based inference methods with doubly-truncated data are developed under
    various models. Nonparametric models are based on Efron and Petrosian (1999) <doi:10.1080/01621459.1999.10474187>
    and Emura, Konno, and Michimae (2015) <doi:10.1007/s10985-014-9297-5>. Parametric
    models from the special exponential family (SEF) are based on Hu and Emura (2015)
    <doi:10.1007/s00180-015-0564-z> and Emura, Hu and Konno (2017) <doi:10.1007/s00362-015-0730-y>.
    The parametric location-scale models are based on Dorre et al. (2020) <doi:10.1007/s00180-020-01027-6>.
