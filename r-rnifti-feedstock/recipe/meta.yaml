  summary: Provides very fast read and write access to images stored in the NIfTI-1 and ANALYZE-7.5
    formats, with seamless synchronisation between compiled C and interpreted R code.
    Also provides a C/C++ API that can be used by other packages. Not to be confused
    with 'RNiftyReg', which performs image registration.
