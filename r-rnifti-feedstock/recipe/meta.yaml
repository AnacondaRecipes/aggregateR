  summary: Provides very fast read and write access to images stored in the NIfTI-1, NIfTI-2
    and ANALYZE-7.5 formats, with seamless synchronisation of in-memory image objects
    between compiled C and interpreted R code. Also provides a simple image viewer,
    and a C/C++ API that can be used by other packages. Not to be confused with 'RNiftyReg',
    which performs image registration and applies spatial transformations.
