  summary: Analyzes non-normal data via the Multiple Comparison Procedures and Modeling approach
    (MCP-Mod). Many functions rely on the 'DoseFinding' package. This package makes
    it so the user does not need to provide or calculate the mu vector and S matrix.
    Instead, the user typically supplies the data in its raw form, and this package
    will calculate the needed objects and passes them into the 'DoseFinding' functions.
    If the user wishes to primarily use the functions provided in the 'DoseFinding'
    package, a singular function (prepareGen()) will provide mu and S. The package currently
    handles power analysis and the MCP-Mod procedure for negative binomial, Poisson,
    and binomial data. The MCP-Mod procedure can also be applied to survival data, but
    power analysis is not available. Bretz, F., Pinheiro, J. C., and Branson, M. (2005)
