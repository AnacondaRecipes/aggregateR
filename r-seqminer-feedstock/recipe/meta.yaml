  summary: Integrate sequencing data (Variant call format, e.g. VCF or BCF) or meta-analysis
    results in R. This package can help you (1) read VCF/BCF/BGEN files by chromosomal
    ranges (e.g. 1:100-200); (2) read RareMETAL summary statistics files; (3) read tables
    from a tabix-indexed files; (4) annotate VCF/BCF files; (5) create customized workflow
    based on Makefile.
