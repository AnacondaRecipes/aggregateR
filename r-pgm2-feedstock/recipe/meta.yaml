  summary: Construction method of nested resolvable designs from a projective geometry defined
    on Galois field of order 2. The obtained Resolvable designs are used to build uniform
    design. The presented results are based on <https://eudml.org/doc/219563> and A.
    Boudraa et al. (See references).
