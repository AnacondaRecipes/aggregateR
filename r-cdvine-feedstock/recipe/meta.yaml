  summary: Functions for statistical inference of canonical vine (C-vine) and D-vine copulas.
    Tools for bivariate exploratory data analysis and for bivariate as well as vine
    copula selection are provided. Models can be estimated either sequentially or by
    joint maximum likelihood estimation. Sampling algorithms and plotting methods are
    also included. Data is assumed to lie in the unit hypercube (so-called copula data).
