  summary: Spontaneous adverse event reports have a high potential for detecting adverse drug
    reactions. However, due to their dimension, the analysis of such databases requires
    statistical methods. We propose to use a logistic regression whose sparsity is viewed
    as a model selection challenge. Since the model space is huge, a Metropolis-Hastings
    algorithm carries out the model selection by maximizing the BIC criterion.
