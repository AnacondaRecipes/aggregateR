  summary: Constructs tables of counts and proportions out of data sets. It has simplified syntax
    appealing for novice and even for advanced user under time pressure. It is particularly
    suitable for exploratory data analysis or presentation to single out most appropriate
    pieces of tabulated information. The other important feature is possibility to insert
    tables to Excel and Word documents. This version also features capacity of log-linear
    and power analyses (original by Oleksandr Ocheredko <doi:10.35566/isdsa2019c5>)
    for tabulated data with GSL.
