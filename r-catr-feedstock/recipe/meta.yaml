  summary: Provides routines for the generation of response patterns under unidimensional dichotomous
    and polytomous computerized adaptive testing (CAT) framework. It holds many standard
    functions to estimate ability, select the first item(s) to administer and optimally
    select the next item, as well as several stopping rules. Options to control for
    item exposure and content balancing are also available (Magis and Barrada (2017)
    <doi:10.18637/jss.v076.c01>).
