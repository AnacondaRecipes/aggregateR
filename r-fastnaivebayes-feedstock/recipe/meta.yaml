  summary: 'This is an extremely fast implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier. This  package
    is currently the only package that supports a Bernoulli distribution, a Multinomial  distribution,
    and a Gaussian distribution, making it suitable for both binary features,  frequency
    counts, and numerical features. Another feature is the support of a mix of  different
    event models. Only numerical variables are allowed, however, categorical variables  can
    be transformed into dummies and used with the Bernoulli distribution.  The implementation
    is largely based on the paper  "A comparison of event models for Naive Bayes anti-spam
    e-mail filtering"  written by K.M. Schneider (2003) <doi:10.3115/1067807>. Any issues
    can be  submitted to: <https://github.com/mskogholt/fastNaiveBayes/issues>.'
