  summary: Contains functions for the analysis of Discrete Time Hidden Markov Models, Markov
    Modulated GLMs and the Markov Modulated Poisson Process. It includes functions for
    simulation, parameter estimation, and the Viterbi algorithm. See the topic "HiddenMarkov"
    for an introduction to the package, and "Change Log" for a list of recent changes.
    The algorithms are based of those of Walter Zucchini.
