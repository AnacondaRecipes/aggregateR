  summary: Provides the functions for planning and conducting a clinical trial with adaptive
    sample size determination. Maximal statistical efficiency will be exploited even
    when dramatic or multiple adaptations are made. Such a trial consists of adaptive
    determination of sample size at an interim analysis and implementation of frequentist
    statistical test at the interim and final analysis with a prefixed significance
    level. The required assumptions for the stage-wise test statistics are independent
    and stationary increments and normality. Predetermination of adaptation rule is
    not required.
