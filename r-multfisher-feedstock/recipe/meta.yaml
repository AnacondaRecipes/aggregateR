  summary: Calculates exact hypothesis tests to compare a treatment and a reference group with
    respect to multiple binary endpoints. The tested null hypothesis is an identical
    multidimensional distribution of successes and failures in both groups. The alternative
    hypothesis is a larger success proportion in the treatment group in at least one
    endpoint. The tests are based on the multivariate permutation distribution of subjects
    between the two groups. For this permutation distribution, rejection regions are
    calculated that satisfy one of different possible optimization criteria. In particular,
    regions with maximal exhaustion of the nominal significance level, maximal power
    under a specified alternative or maximal number of elements can be found. Optimization
    is achieved by a branch-and-bound algorithm. By application of the closed testing
    principle, the global hypothesis tests are extended to multiple testing procedures.
