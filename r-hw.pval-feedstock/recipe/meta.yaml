  summary: HW.pval calculates plain and fully conditional root-mean-square, chi-square, and log
    likelihood-ratio P-values for the user-provided genotypic counts to be consistent
    with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium model.  For further information on the Hardy-Weinberg
    equilibrium model and the pseudocode, refer to the paper "Testing Hardy-Weinberg
    equilibrium with a simple root-mean-square statistic" by Rachel Ward.
