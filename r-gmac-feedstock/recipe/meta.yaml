  summary: Performs genomic mediation analysis with adaptive confounding adjustment (GMAC) proposed
    by Yang et al. (2017) <doi:10.1101/078683>. It implements large scale mediation
    analysis and adaptively selects potential confounding variables to adjust for each
    mediation test from a pool of candidate confounders. The package is tailored for
    but not limited to genomic mediation analysis (e.g., cis-gene mediating trans-gene
    regulation pattern where an eQTL, its cis-linking gene transcript, and its trans-gene
    transcript play the roles as treatment, mediator and the outcome, respectively),
    restricting to scenarios with the presence of cis-association (i.e., treatment-mediator
    association) and random eQTL (i.e., treatment).
