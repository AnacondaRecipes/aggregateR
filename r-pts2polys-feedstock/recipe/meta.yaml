  summary: Various applications in invasive species biology, conservation biology, epidemiology
    and elsewhere involve  sampling of sets of 2D points from a posterior distribution.
    The number of such point sets may be large, say 1000 or 10000.  This package facilitates
    visualisation of such output by  constructing seven nested polygons representing
    the location and  variability of the point sets. This can be used, for example,
    to  visualise the range boundary of a species, and uncertainty in  the location
    of that boundary.
