  summary: waffect (pronounced 'double-u affect' for 'weighted affectation') is a package to
    simulate phenotypic (case or control) datasets under a disease model H1 such that
    the total number of cases is constant across all the simulations (the constrain
    in the title). The package also makes it possible to generate phenotypes in the
    case of more than two classes, so that the number of phenotypes belonging to each
    class is constant across all the simulations. waffect is used to assess empirically
    the statistical power of Genome Wide Association studies.
