  summary: 'Provides functions to test for a treatment effect in terms of the difference in survival
    between a treatment group and a control group using surrogate marker information
    obtained at some early time point in a time-to-event outcome setting. Nonparametric
    kernel estimation is used to estimate the test statistic and perturbation resampling
    is used for variance estimation. More details will be available in the future in:
    Parast L, Cai T, Tian L (2019). Using a Surrogate Marker for Early Testing of a
    Treatment Effect. Biometrics, In press.'
