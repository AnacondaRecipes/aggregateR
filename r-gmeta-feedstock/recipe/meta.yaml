  summary: An implementation of an all-in-one function for a wide range of meta-analysis problems.
    It contains three functions. The gmeta() function unifies all standard meta-analysis
    methods and also several newly developed ones under a framework of combining confidence
    distributions (CDs). Specifically, the package can perform classical p-value combination
    methods (such as methods of Fisher, Stouffer, Tippett, etc.), fit meta-analysis
    fixed-effect and random-effects models, and synthesizes 2x2 tables. Furthermore,
    it can perform robust meta-analysis, which provides protection against model-misspecifications,
    and limits the impact of any unknown outlying studies. In addition, the package
    implements two exact meta-analysis methods from synthesizing 2x2 tables with rare
    events (e.g., zero total event). The np.gmeta() function summarizes information
    obtained from multiple studies and makes inference for study-level parameters with
    no distributional assumption. Specifically, it can construct confidence intervals
    for unknown, fixed study-level parameters via confidence distribution. Furthermore,
    it can perform  estimation via asymptotic confidence distribution whether tie or
    near tie condition exist or not. The plot.gmeta() function to visualize individual
    and combined CDs through extended forest plots is also available. Compared to version
    2.2-6, version 2.3-0 contains a new function np.gmeta().
