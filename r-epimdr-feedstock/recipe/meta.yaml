  summary: 'Functions, data sets and shiny apps for "Epidemics: Models and Data in R" by Ottar
    N. Bjornstad (ISBN 978-3-319-97487-3) <https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319974866>.
    The package contains functions to study the S(E)IR model, spatial and age-structured
    SIR models; time-series SIR and chain-binomial stochastic models; catalytic disease
    models; coupled map lattice models of spatial transmission and network models for
    social spread of infection. The package is also an advanced quantitative companion
    to the coursera Epidemics Massive Online Open Course <https://www.coursera.org/learn/epidemics>.'
