  summary: 'An improved implementation (based on k-nearest neighbors) of the density peak clustering
    algorithm, originally described by Alex Rodriguez and Alessandro Laio (Science,
    2014 vol. 344) <DOI: 10.1126/science.1242072>. It can handle large datasets (> 100,
    000 samples) very efficiently. It was initially implemented by Thomas Lin Pedersen,
    with inputs from Sean Hughes and later improved by Xiaojie Qiu to handle large datasets
    with kNNs.'
