  summary: Dependency-free, ultra fast calculation of geodesic distances.  Includes the reference
    nanometre-accuracy geodesic distances of Karney (2013) <doi:10.1007/s00190-012-0578-z>,
    as used by the 'sf' package, as well as Haversine and Vincenty distances. Default
    distance measure is the "Mapbox cheap ruler" which is generally more accurate than
    Haversine or Vincenty for distances out to a few hundred kilometres, and is considerably
    faster. The main function accepts one or two inputs in almost any generic rectangular
    form, and returns either matrices of pairwise distances, or vectors of sequential
    distances.
