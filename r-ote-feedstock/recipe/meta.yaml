  summary: Functions for creating ensembles of optimal trees for regression, classification and
    class membership probability estimation are given. A few trees are selected from
    an initial set of trees grown by random forest for the ensemble on the basis of
    their individual and collective performance. Trees are assessed on out-of-bag data
    and on an independent training data set for individual and collective performance
    respectively. The prediction functions return estimates of the test responses and
    their class membership probabilities. Unexplained variations, error rates, confusion
    matrix, Brier scores, etc. are also returned for the test data.
