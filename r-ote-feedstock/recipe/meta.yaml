  summary: Functions for creating ensembles of optimal trees for regression, classification (Khan,
    Z., Gul, A., Perperoglou, A., Miftahuddin, M., Mahmoud, O., Adler, W., & Lausen,
    B. (2019). (2019) <doi:10.1007/s11634-019-00364-9>) and class membership probability
    estimation (Khan, Z, Gul, A, Mahmoud, O, Miftahuddin, M, Perperoglou, A, Adler,
    W & Lausen, B (2016) <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-25226-1_34>) are given. A few trees
    are selected from an initial set of trees grown by random forest for the ensemble
    on the basis of their individual and collective performance. Three different methods
    of tree selection for the case of classification are given. The prediction functions
    return estimates of the test responses and their class membership probabilities.
    Unexplained variations, error rates, confusion matrix, Brier scores, etc. are also
    returned for the test data.
