  summary: Provides intuitive functions for caching R objects, encouraging reproducible, restartable,
    and distributed R analysis. The user selects a location to store caches, and then
    provides  nothing more than a cache name and instructions (R code) for how to produce
    the R object. Also provides some advanced options like environment assignments,
    recreating or reloading caches, and cluster compute bindings (using the 'batchtools'
    package) making it flexible enough for use in large-scale data analysis projects.
