  summary: Read data files readable by 'gnumeric' into 'R'. Can read whole sheet or a range,
    from several file formats, including the native format of 'gnumeric'. Reading is
    done by using 'ssconvert' (a file converter utility included in the 'gnumeric' distribution
    <http://www.gnumeric.org>) to convert the requested part to CSV. From 'gnumeric'
    files (but not other formats) can list sheet names and sheet sizes or read all sheets.
