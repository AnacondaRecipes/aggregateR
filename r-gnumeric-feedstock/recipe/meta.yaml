  summary: Read data files readable by 'gnumeric' into 'R'. Can read whole sheet or a range,
    from several file formats, including the native format of 'gnumeric'. Reading is
    done by using 'ssconvert' (a file converter utility included in the 'gnumeric' distribution
    <http://projects.gnome.org/gnumeric/>) to convert the requested part to CSV. From
    'gnumeric' files (but not other formats) can list sheet names and sheet sizes or
    read all sheets.
