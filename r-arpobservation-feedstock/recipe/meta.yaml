  summary: 'Tools for simulating data generated by direct observation recording. Behavior streams
    are simulated based on an alternating renewal process, given specified distributions
    of event durations and interim times. Different procedures for recording data can
    then be applied to the simulated behavior streams. Functions are provided for the
    following recording methods: continuous duration recording, event counting, momentary
    time sampling, partial interval recording, whole interval recording, and augmented
    interval recording.'
