  summary: Factor analysis implementation for multiple data sources, i.e., for groups of variables.
    The whole data analysis pipeline is provided, including functions and recommendations
    for data normalization and model definition, as well as missing value prediction
    and model visualization. The model group factor analysis (GFA) is inferred with
    Gibbs sampling, and it has been presented originally by Virtanen et al. (2012),
    and extended in Klami et al. (2015) <DOI:10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2376974> and Bunte et
    al. (2016) <DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw207>; for details, see the citation info.
