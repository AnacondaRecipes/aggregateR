  summary: Linguistic Descriptions of Complex Phenomena (LDCP) is an architecture and methodology
    that allows us to model complex phenomena, interpreting input data, and generating
    automatic text reports customized to the user needs (see <doi:10.1016/j.ins.2016.11.002>
    and <doi:10.1007/s00500-016-2430-5>). The proposed package contains a set of methods
    that facilitates the development of LDCP systems. It main goal is increasing the
    visibility and practical use of this research line.
