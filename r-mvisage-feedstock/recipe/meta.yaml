  summary: Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients are commonly used to quantify the strength
    of bivariate associations of genomic variables.  For example, correlations of gene-level
    DNA copy number and gene expression measurements may be used to assess the impact
    of DNA copy number changes on gene expression in tumor tissue.  'MVisAGe' enables
    users to quickly compute and visualize the correlations in order to assess the effect
    of regional genomic events such as changes in DNA copy number or DNA methylation
    level.  Please see Walter V, Du Y, Danilova L, Hayward MC, Hayes DN, 2018. Cancer
    Research <doi:10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-3464>.
