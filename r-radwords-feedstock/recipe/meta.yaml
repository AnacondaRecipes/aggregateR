  summary: Aims at loading Google Adwords data into R. Adwords is an online advertising service
    that enables advertisers to display advertising copy to web users (see <https://developers.google.com/adwords/>
    for more information). Therefore the package implements three main features. First,
    the package provides an authentication process for R with the Google Adwords API
    (see <https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/> for more information) via OAUTH2.
    Second, the package offers an interface to apply the Adwords query language in R
    and query the Adwords API with ad-hoc reports. Third, the received data are transformed
    into suitable data formats for further data processing and data analysis.
