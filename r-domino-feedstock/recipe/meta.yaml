  summary: A wrapper on top of the 'Domino Command-Line Client'. It lets you run 'Domino' commands
    (e.g., "run", "upload", "download") directly from your R environment. Under the
    hood, it uses R's system function to run the 'Domino' executable, which must be
    installed as a prerequisite. 'Domino' is a service that makes it easy to run your
    code on scalable hardware, with integrated version control and collaboration features
    designed for analytical workflows (see <http://www.dominodatalab.com> for more information).
