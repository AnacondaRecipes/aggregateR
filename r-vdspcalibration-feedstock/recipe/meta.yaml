  summary: Provides statistical methods for the design and analysis of a calibration study, which
    aims for calibrating measurements using two different methods. The package includes
    sample size calculation, sample selection,  regression analysis with error-in measurements
    and change-point regression. The method is described in Tian, Durazo-Arvizu, Myers,
    et al. (2014) <DOI:10.1002/sim.6235>.
