  summary: Fits models from Miller et al. 2005 to estimate population sizes from natural populations.
    Several models are implemented. Package also includes functions to perform a likelihood
    ratio test to choose between models, perform parametric bootstrapping to obtain
    confidence intervals and multiple functions to simulate data.
