  summary: Contains procedures for depth-based supervised learning, which are entirely non-parametric,
    in particular the DDalpha-procedure (Lange, Mosler and Mozharovskyi, 2014). The
    training data sample is transformed by a statistical depth function to a compact
    low-dimensional space, where the final classification is done. It also offers an
    extension to functional data and routines for calculating certain notions of statistical
    depth functions. 50 multivariate and 5 functional classification problems are included.
