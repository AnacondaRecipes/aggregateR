  summary: Perform association tests using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) in genome-wide
    association studies (GWAS) and sequencing association studies. First, GMMAT fits
    a GLMM with covariate adjustment and random effects to account for population structure
    and familial or cryptic relatedness. For GWAS, GMMAT performs score tests for each
    genetic variant as proposed in Chen et al. (2016) <DOI:10.1016/j.ajhg.2016.02.012>.
    For candidate gene studies, GMMAT can also perform Wald tests to get the effect
    size estimate for each genetic variant. For rare variant analysis from sequencing
    association studies, GMMAT performs the variant Set Mixed Model Association Tests
    (SMMAT) as proposed in Chen et al. (2019) <DOI:10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.12.012>, including
    the burden test, the sequence kernel association test (SKAT), SKAT-O and an efficient
    hybrid test of the burden test and SKAT, based on user-defined variant sets.
