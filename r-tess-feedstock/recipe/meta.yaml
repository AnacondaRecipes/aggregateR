  summary: Simulation of reconstructed phylogenetic trees under tree-wide time-heterogeneous
    birth-death processes and estimation of diversification parameters under the same
    model. Speciation and extinction rates can be any function of time and mass-extinction
    events at specific times can be provided. Trees can be simulated either conditioned
    on the number of species, the time of the process, or both. Additionally, the likelihood
    equations are implemented for convenience and can be used for Maximum Likelihood
    (ML) estimation and Bayesian inference.
