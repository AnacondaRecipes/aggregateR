  summary: Formats for R Markdown that undo modifications by 'pandoc' and 'rmarkdown' to original
    'latex' templates, such as smaller margins, paragraph spacing, and compact titles.
    In addition, enhancements such as author blocks with affiliations and headers and
    footers are introduced. All of this functionality is built around plugins that modify
    the default 'pandoc' template without relying on custom templates.
