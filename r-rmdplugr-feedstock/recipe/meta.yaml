  summary: Formats for R Markdown that undo modifications by 'pandoc' and 'rmarkdown' to original
    'latex' templates, such as smaller margins, paragraph spacing, and compact titles.
    In addition,  enhancements such as author blocks with affiliations and headers and
    footers are introduced. All of this functionality is built  around plugins that
    modify the default 'pandoc' template without relying on  custom templates.
