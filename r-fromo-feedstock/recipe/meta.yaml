  summary: Fast, numerically robust computation of weighted moments via 'Rcpp'.  Supports computation
    on vectors and matrices, and Monoidal append of moments.  Moments and cumulants
    over running fixed length windows can be computed,  as well as over time-based windows.
    Moment computations are via a generalization of Welford's method, as described by
    Bennett et. (2009) <doi:10.1109/CLUSTR.2009.5289161>.
