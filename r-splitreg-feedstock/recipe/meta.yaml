  summary: Functions for computing split regularized estimators defined in Christidis, Lakshmanan,
    Smucler and Zamar (2019) <arXiv:1712.03561>. The approach fits linear regression
    models that split the set of covariates into groups. The optimal split of the variables
    into groups and the regularized estimation of the regression coefficients are performed
    by minimizing  an objective function that encourages sparsity within each group
    and diversity among them. The estimated coefficients are then pooled together to
    form the final fit.
