  summary: Provides functions to express clock time data relative to anchor points (typically
    solar); fit kernel density functions to animal activity time data; plot activity
    distributions; quantify overall levels of activity; statistically compare activity
    metrics through bootstrapping; evaluate variation in linear variables with time
    (or other circular variables).
