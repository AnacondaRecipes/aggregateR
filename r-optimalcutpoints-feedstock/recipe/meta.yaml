  summary: Computes optimal cutpoints for diagnostic tests or continuous markers. Various approaches
    for selecting optimal cutoffs have been implemented, including methods based on
    cost-benefit analysis and diagnostic test accuracy measures (Sensitivity/Specificity,
    Predictive Values and Diagnostic Likelihood Ratios). Numerical and graphical output
    for all methods is easily obtained.
