  summary: Provides a collection of functions to explore and to investigate basic properties
    of financial returns and related quantities. The covered fields include techniques
    of explorative data analysis and the investigation of distributional properties,
    including parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. Even more there are several
    utility functions for data handling and management.
