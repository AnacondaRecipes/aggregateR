  summary: Provides software to facilitate the design, testing, and operation of computer models.
    It focuses particularly on tools that make it easy to construct and edit a customized
    graphical user interface ('GUI'). Although our simplified 'GUI' language depends
    heavily on the R interface to the 'Tcl/Tk' package, a user does not need to know
    'Tcl/Tk'. Examples illustrate models built with other R packages, including 'PBSmapping',
    'PBSddesolve', and 'BRugs'.  A complete user's guide 'PBSmodelling-UG.pdf' shows
    how to use this package effectively.
