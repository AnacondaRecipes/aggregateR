  summary: Contains tools for survey statistics (especially in educational assessment) for datasets
    with replication designs (jackknife, bootstrap, replicate weights; see Kolenikov,
    2010; Pfefferman & Rao, 2009a, 2009b, <doi:10.1016/S0169-7161(09)70003-3>, <doi:10.1016/S0169-7161(09)70037-9>);
    Shao, 1996, <doi:10.1080/02331889708802523>). Descriptive statistics, linear and
    logistic regression, path models for manifest variables with measurement error correction
    and two-level hierarchical regressions for weighted samples are included. Statistical
    inference can be conducted for multiply imputed datasets and nested multiply imputed
    datasets and is in particularly suited for the analysis of plausible values (for
    details see George, Oberwimmer & Itzlinger-Bruneforth, 2016; Bruneforth, Oberwimmer
    & Robitzsch, 2016; Robitzsch, Pham & Yanagida, 2016). The package development was
    supported by BIFIE (Federal Institute for Educational Research, Innovation and Development
    of the Austrian School System; Salzburg, Austria).
