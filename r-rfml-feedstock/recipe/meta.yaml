  summary: Functionality required to efficiently use R with MarkLogic NoSQL Database Server,
    <http://www.marklogic.com/what-is-marklogic/>. Many basic and complex R operations
    are pushed down into the database, which removes the main memory boundary of R and
    allows to make full use of MarkLogic server. In order to use the package you need
