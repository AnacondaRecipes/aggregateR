  summary: 'Provides a fast and scalable joint estimator for integrating additional knowledge
    in learning multiple related sparse Gaussian Graphical Models (JEEK). The JEEK algorithm
    can be used to fast estimate multiple related precision matrices in a large-scale.
    For instance, it can identify multiple gene networks from multi-context gene expression
    datasets. By performing data-driven network inference from high-dimensional and
    heterogeneous data sets, this tool can help users effectively translate aggregated
    data into knowledge that take the form of graphs among entities. Please run demo(jeek)
    to learn the basic functions provided by this package. For further details, please
    read the original paper: Beilun Wang, Arshdeep Sekhon, Yanjun Qi "A Fast and Scalable
    Joint Estimator for Integrating Additional Knowledge in Learning Multiple Related
    Sparse Gaussian Graphical Models" (ICML 2018) <arXiv:1806.00548>.'
