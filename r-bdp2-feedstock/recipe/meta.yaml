  summary: Tools and workflow to choose design parameters in Bayesian adaptive single-arm phase
    II trial designs with binary endpoint (response, success) with possible stopping
    for efficacy and futility at interim analyses. Also contains routines to determine
    and visualize operating characteristics. See Kopp-Schneider et al. (2018) <doi:10.1002/bimj.201700209>.
