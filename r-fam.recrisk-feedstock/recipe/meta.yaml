  summary: Given vectors of family sizes and number of affecteds per family, calculates the risk
    of disease recurrence in an unaffected person, conditional on a family having at
    least k affected members. Methods also model heterogeneity of disease risk across
    families by fitting a mixture model, allowing for high and low risk families.
