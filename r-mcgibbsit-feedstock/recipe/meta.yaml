  summary: '''mcgibbsit'' provides an implementation of Warnes & Raftery''s MCGibbsit run-length
    diagnostic for a set of (not-necessarily independent) MCMC samplers.  It combines
    the estimate error-bounding approach of the Raftery and Lewis MCMC run length diagnostic
    with the between verses within chain approach of the Gelman and Rubin MCMC convergence
    diagnostic.'
