  summary: Implementation of Warnes & Raftery's MCGibbsit run-length and convergence diagnostic
    for a set of (not-necessarily independent) Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers.  It
    combines the quantile estimate error-bounding approach of the Raftery and Lewis
    MCMC run length diagnostic `gibbsit` with the between verses within chain approach
    of the Gelman and Rubin MCMC convergence diagnostic.
