  summary: Functions to calculate some point estimators and estimate their variance under unequal
    probability sampling without replacement. Single and two-stage sampling designs
    are considered. Some approximations for the second-order inclusion probabilities
    (joint inclusion probabilities) are available (sample and population based). A variety
    of Jackknife variance estimators are implemented. Almost every function is written
    in C (compiled) code for faster results. The functions incorporate some performance
    improvements for faster results with large datasets.
