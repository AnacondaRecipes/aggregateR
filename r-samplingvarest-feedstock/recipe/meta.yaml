  summary: Functions to calculate some point estimators and estimating their variance under unequal
    probability sampling without replacement. Single and two stage sampling designs
    are considered. Some approximations for the second order inclusion probabilities
    (joint inclusion probabilities) are available (sample and population based). A variety
    of Jackknife variance estimators are implemented. Almost every function is written
    in C (compiled) code for faster results. The functions incorporate some performance
    improvements for faster results with large datasets.
