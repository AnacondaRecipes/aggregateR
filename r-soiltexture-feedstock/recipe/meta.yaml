  summary: '"The Soil Texture Wizard" is a set of R functions designed to produce texture triangles
    (also called texture plots, texture diagrams, texture ternary plots), classify and
    transform soil textures data. These functions virtually allows to plot any soil
    texture triangle (classification) into any triangle geometry (isosceles, right-angled
    triangles, etc.). This set of function is expected to be useful to people using
    soil textures data from different soil texture classification or different particle
    size systems. Many (> 15) texture triangles from all around the world are predefined
    in the package. A simple text based graphical user interface is provided: soiltexture_gui().'
