  summary: Import data of tests and questionnaires from FormScanner. FormScanner is an open source
    software that converts scanned images to data using optical mark recognition (OMR)
    and it can be downloaded from <http://sourceforge.net/projects/formscanner/>. The
    spreadsheet file created by FormScanner is imported in a convenient format to perform
    the analyses provided by the package. These analyses include the conversion of multiple
    responses to binary (correct/incorrect) data, the computation of the number of corrected
    responses for each subject or item, scoring using weights,the computation and the
    graphical representation of the frequencies of the responses to each item and the
    report of the responses of a few subjects.
