  summary: 'In randomized-controlled trials, interim analyses are often planned for possible
    early  trial termination to claim superiority or futility of a new therapy. Blinded
    data also have  information about the potential treatment difference between the
    groups. We developed a blinded  data monitoring tool that enables investigators
    to predict whether they observe such an unblinded  interim analysis results that
    supports early termination of the trial. Investigators may skip  some of the planned
    interim analyses if an early termination is unlikely.  This tool will provide reference
    information about N: Sample size at interim analysis, and T: Total  number of responders
    at interim analysis for decision on performing an interim analysis.'
