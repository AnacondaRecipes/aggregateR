  summary: A data mining tool for discovering subgroups of patients and genes that simultaneously
    display unusual levels of variability compared to other genes and patients. Based
    on sparse singular value decomposition (SSVD), the method can detect both mean and
    variance biclusters in the presence of heterogeneous residual variance.
