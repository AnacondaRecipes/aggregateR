  summary: An implementation of robust estimation in Cox model. Functionality includes fitting
    efficiently and robustly Cox proportional hazards regression model in its basic
    form, where explanatory variables are time independent with one event per subject.  Method
    is based on a smooth modification of the partial likelihood.
