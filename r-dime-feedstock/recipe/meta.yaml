  summary: 'A robust identification of differential binding sites method for analyzing ChIP-seq
    (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing) comparing two samples that considers
    an ensemble of finite mixture models combined with a local false discovery rate
    (fdr) allowing for flexible modeling of data. Methods for Differential Identification
    using Mixture Ensemble (DIME) is described in: Taslim et al., (2011) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btr165>.'
