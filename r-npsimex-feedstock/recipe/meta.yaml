  summary: 'This package contains a collection of functions to to perform nonparametric deconvolution
    using simulation extrapolation (SIMEX). We propose an estimator that adopts the
    SIMEX idea but bypasses the simulation step in the original SIMEX algorithm. There
    is no bandwidth parameter and the estimate is determined by appropriately selecting
    "design points". See details in: Wang, X.F., Sun, J. and Fan, Z. (2011). Deconvolution
    density estimation with heteroscedastic errors using SIMEX.'
