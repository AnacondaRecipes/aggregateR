  summary: 'Speed up common tasks, particularly logical or relational comparisons and routine
    follow up tasks such as finding the indices and subsetting. Inspired by mathematics,
    where something like: 3 < x < 6 is a standard, elegant and clear way to assert that
    x is both greater than 3 and less than 6 (see for example <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_operator>),
    a chaining operator is implemented. The chaining operator, %c%, allows multiple
    relational operations to be used in quotes on the right hand side for the same object,
    on the left hand side. The %e% operator allows something like set-builder notation
    (see for example <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-builder_notation>) to be used
    on the right hand side. All operators have built in prefixes defined for all, subset,
    and which to reduce the amount of code needed for common tasks, such as return those
    values that are true.'
