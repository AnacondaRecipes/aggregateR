  summary: This package allows to use the hybrid Multinomial-Dirichlet-Model of Ecological Inference
    for estimating inner Cells of RxC-Tables. This was already implemented in the eiPack-package.
    eiwild-package now has the possibility to use individual level data to support the
    aggregate level data and using different Hyperpriori-Distributions.
