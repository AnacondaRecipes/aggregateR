  summary: 'A major challenge in estimating treatment decision rules from a randomized clinical
    trial dataset with covariates measured at baseline lies in detecting relatively
    small treatment effect modification-related variability (i.e., the treatment-by-covariates
    interaction effects on treatment outcomes) against a relatively large non-treatment-related
    variability (i.e., the main effects of covariates on treatment outcomes). The class
    of Single-Index Models with Multiple-Links is a novel single-index model specifically
    designed to estimate a single-index (a linear combination) of the covariates associated
    with the treatment effect modification-related variability, while allowing a nonlinear
    association with the treatment outcomes via flexible link functions. The models
    provide a flexible regression approach to developing treatment decision rules based
    on patients'' data measured at baseline. We refer to Petkova, Tarpey, Su, and Ogden
    (2017) <doi: 10.1093/biostatistics/kxw035> and "A constrained single-index model
    for estimating interactions between a treatment and covariates" (under review, 2019)
    for detail. The main function of this package is simml(). '

# Description: A major challenge in estimating treatment decision rules from a randomized clinical trial dataset with covariates measured at baseline lies in detecting relatively small treatment effect modification-related variability (i.e., the treatment-by-covariates interaction effects on treatment outcomes) against a relatively large non-treatment-related variability (i.e., the main effects of covariates on treatment outcomes). The class of Single-Index Models with Multiple-Links is a novel single-index model specifically designed to estimate a single-index (a linear combination) of the covariates associated with the treatment effect modification-related variability, while allowing a nonlinear association with the treatment outcomes via flexible link functions. The models provide a flexible regression approach to developing treatment decision rules based on patients' data measured at baseline. We refer to Petkova, Tarpey, Su, and Ogden (2017) <doi: 10.1093/biostatistics/kxw035> and "A constrained single-index model for estimating interactions between a treatment and covariates" (under review, 2019) for detail.
