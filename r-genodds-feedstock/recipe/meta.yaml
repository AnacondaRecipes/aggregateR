  summary: Calculates Agresti's (1980) <https://www.jstor.org/stable/2530495> generalized odds
    ratios. For a randomly selected pair of observations from two groups, calculates
    the odds that the second group will have a higher scoring outcome than that of the
    first group. Package provides hypothesis testing for if this odds ratio is significantly
    different to 1 (equal chance).
