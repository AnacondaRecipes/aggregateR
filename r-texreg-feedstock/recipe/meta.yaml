  summary: Converts coefficients, standard errors, significance stars, and goodness-of-fit statistics
    of statistical models into LaTeX tables or HTML tables/MS Word documents or to nicely
    formatted screen output for the R console for easy model comparison. A list of several
    models can be combined in a single table. The output is highly customizable. New
    model types can be easily implemented.
