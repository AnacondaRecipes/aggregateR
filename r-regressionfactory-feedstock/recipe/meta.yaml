  summary: The expander functions rely on the mathematics developed for the Hessian-definiteness
    invariance theorem for linear projection transformations of variables, described
    in authors' paper, to generate the full, high-dimensional gradient and Hessian from
    the lower-dimensional derivative objects. This greatly relieves the computational
    burden of generating the regression-function derivatives, which in turn can be fed
    into any optimization routine that utilizes such derivatives. The theorem guarantees
    that Hessian definiteness is preserved, meaning that reasoning about this property
    can be performed in the low-dimensional space of the base distribution. This is
    often a much easier task than its equivalent in the full, high-dimensional space.
    Definiteness of Hessian can be useful in selecting optimization/sampling algorithms
    such as Newton-Raphson optimization or its sampling equivalent, the Stochastic Newton
    Sampler. Finally, in addition to being a computational tool, the regression expansion
    framework is of conceptual value by offering new opportunities to generate novel
    regression problems.
