  summary: Basic infrastructure and some algorithms for the traveling salesperson problem (also
    traveling salesman problem; TSP). The package provides some simple algorithms and
    an interface to the Concorde TSP solver and its implementation of the Chained-Lin-Kernighan
    heuristic. The code for Concorde itself is not included in the package and has to
    be obtained separately.
