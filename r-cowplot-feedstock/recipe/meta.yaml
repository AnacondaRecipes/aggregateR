  summary: Provides various features that help with creating publication-quality figures with
    'ggplot2', such as a set of themes, functions to align plots and arrange them into
    complex compound figures, and functions that make it easy to annotate plots and
    or mix plots with images. The package was originally written for internal use in
    the Wilke lab, hence the name (Claus O. Wilke's plot package). It has also been
    used extensively in the book Fundamentals of Data Visualization.
