  summary: 'Estimation of reproduction numbers for disease outbreak, based on incidence data.
    The R0 package implements several documented methods. It is therefore possible to
    compare estimations according to the methods used. Depending on the methods requested
    by user, basic reproduction number (commonly denoted as R0) or real-time reproduction
    number (referred to as R(t)) is computed, along with a 95% Confidence Interval.
    Plotting outputs will give different graphs depending on the methods requested :
    basic reproductive number estimations will only show the epidemic curve (collected
    data) and an adjusted model, whereas real-time methods will also show the R(t) variations
    throughout the outbreak time period. Sensitivity analysis tools are also provided,
    and allow for investigating effects of varying Generation Time distribution or time
    window on estimates.'
