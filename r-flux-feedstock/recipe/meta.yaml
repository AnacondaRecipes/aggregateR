  summary: 'Functions for the calculation of greenhouse gas flux rates  from closed chamber concentration
    measurements. The package follows  a modular concept: Fluxes can be calculated in
    just two simple steps  or in several steps if more control in details is wanted.
    Additionally  plot and preparation functions as well as functions for modelling
    gpp and reco are provided.'
