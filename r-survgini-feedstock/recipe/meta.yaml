  summary: The Gini concentration test for survival data is a nonparametric test based on the
    Gini index for testing the equality of two survival distributions from the point
    of view of concentration. The package compares different nonparametric tests (asymptotic
    Gini test, permutation Gini test, log-rank test, Gray-Tsiatis test and Wilcoxon
    test) and computes their p-values.
