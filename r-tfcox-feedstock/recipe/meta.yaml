  summary: In Cox's proportional hazard model, covariates are modeled as linear function and
    may not be flexible. This package implements additive trend filtering Cox proportional
    hazards model as proposed in Jiacheng Wu & Daniela Witten (2019) "Flexible and Interpretable
    Models for Survival Data", Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, <DOI:10.1080/10618600.2019.1592758>.
    The fitted functions are piecewise polynomial with adaptively chosen knots.
