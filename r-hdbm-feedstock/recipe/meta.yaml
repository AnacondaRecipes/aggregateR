  summary: Perform mediation analysis in the presence of high-dimensional mediators based on
    the potential outcome framework. High dimensional Bayesian mediation (HDBM), developed
    by Song et al (2018) <doi:10.1101/467399>, relies on two Bayesian sparse linear
    mixed models to simultaneously analyze a relatively large number of mediators for
    a continuous exposure and outcome assuming a small number of mediators are truly
    active. This sparsity assumption also allows the extension of univariate mediator
    analysis by casting the identification of active mediators as a variable selection
    problem and applying Bayesian methods with continuous shrinkage priors on the effects.
