  summary: 'The program implements the COPPE-Cosenza Fuzzy Hierarchy Model. The model was based
    on the evaluation of local alternatives, representing regional potentialities, so
    as to fulfill demands of economic projects. After defining demand profiles in terms
    of their technological coefficients, the degree of importance of factors is defined
    so as to represent the productive activity. The method can detect a surplus of supply
    without the restriction of the distance of classical algebra, defining a hierarchy
    of location alternatives. In COPPE-Cosenza Model, the distance between factors is
    measured in terms of the difference between grades of memberships of the same factors
    belonging to two or more  sets under comparison. The required factors are classified
    under the following linguistic variables: Critical (CR); Conditioning (C); Little
    Conditioning (LC); and Irrelevant (I). And the alternatives can assume the following
    linguistic variables: Excellent (Ex), Good (G), Regular (R), Weak (W), Empty (Em),
    Zero (Z) and Inexistent (In). The model also provides flexibility, allowing different
    aggregation rules to be performed and defined by the Decision Maker. Such feature
    is considered in this package, allowing the user to define other aggregation matrices,
    since it considers the same linguistic variables mentioned.'
