  summary: Advances in sequencing technology now allow researchers to capture the expression
    profiles of individual cells. Several algorithms have been developed to attempt
    to account for these effects by determining a cell's so-called `pseudotime', or
    relative biological state of transition. By applying these algorithms to single-cell
    sequencing data, we can sort cells into their pseudotemporal ordering based on gene
    expression. LEAP (Lag-based Expression Association for Pseudotime-series) then applies
    a time-series inspired lag-based correlation analysis to reveal linearly dependent
    genetic associations.
