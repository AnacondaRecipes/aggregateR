  summary: This package contains a database of city, state, latitude, and longitude information
    for U.S. ZIP codes from the CivicSpace Database (August 2004) augmented by Daniel
    Coven's federalgovernmentzipcodes.us web site (updated January 22, 2012). Previous
    versions of this package (before 1.0) were based solely on the CivicSpace data,
    so an original version of the CivicSpace database is also included.
