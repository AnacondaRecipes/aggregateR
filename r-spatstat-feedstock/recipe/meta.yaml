  summary: Comprehensive open-source toolbox for analysing Spatial Point Patterns. Focused mainly
    on two-dimensional point patterns, including multitype/marked points, in any spatial
    region. Also supports three-dimensional point patterns, space-time point patterns
    in any number of dimensions, point patterns on a linear network, and patterns of
    other geometrical objects. Supports spatial covariate data such as pixel images.
    Contains over 2000 functions for plotting spatial data, exploratory data analysis,
    model-fitting, simulation, spatial sampling, model diagnostics, and formal inference.
    Data types include point patterns, line segment patterns, spatial windows, pixel
    images, tessellations, and linear networks. Exploratory methods include quadrat
    counts, K-functions and their simulation envelopes, nearest neighbour distance and
    empty space statistics, Fry plots, pair correlation function, kernel smoothed intensity,
    relative risk estimation with cross-validated bandwidth selection, mark correlation
    functions, segregation indices, mark dependence diagnostics, and kernel estimates
    of covariate effects. Formal hypothesis tests of random pattern (chi-squared, Kolmogorov-Smirnov,
    Monte Carlo, Diggle-Cressie-Loosmore-Ford, Dao-Genton, two-stage Monte Carlo) and
    tests for covariate effects (Cox-Berman-Waller-Lawson, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, ANOVA)
    are also supported. Parametric models can be fitted to point pattern data using
    the functions ppm(), kppm(), slrm(), dppm() similar to glm(). Types of models include
    Poisson, Gibbs and Cox point processes, Neyman-Scott cluster processes, and determinantal
    point processes. Models may involve dependence on covariates, inter-point interaction,
    cluster formation and dependence on marks. Models are fitted by maximum likelihood,
    logistic regression, minimum contrast, and composite likelihood methods. A model
    can be fitted to a list of point patterns (replicated point pattern data) using
    the function mppm(). The model can include random effects and fixed effects depending
    on the experimental design, in addition to all the features listed above. Fitted
    point process models can be simulated, automatically. Formal hypothesis tests of
    a fitted model are supported (likelihood ratio test, analysis of deviance, Monte
    Carlo tests) along with basic tools for model selection (stepwise(), AIC()) and
    variable selection (sdr). Tools for validating the fitted model include simulation
    envelopes, residuals, residual plots and Q-Q plots, leverage and influence diagnostics,
    partial residuals, and added variable plots.
