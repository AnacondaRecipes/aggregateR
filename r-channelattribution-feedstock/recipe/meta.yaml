  summary: Advertisers use a variety of online marketing channels to reach consumers and they
    want to know the degree each channel contributes to their marketing success. This
    is called the online multi-channel attribution problem. This package contains a
    probabilistic algorithm for the attribution problem. The model uses a k-order Markov
    representation to identify structural correlations in the customer journey data.
    The package also contains three heuristic algorithms (first-touch, last-touch and
    linear-touch approach) for the same problem. The algorithms are implemented in C++.
