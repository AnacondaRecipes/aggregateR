  summary: Advertisers use a variety of online marketing channels to reach consumers and they
    want to know the degree each channel contributes to their marketing success. This
    is called online multi-channel attribution problem. This package contains a probabilistic
    algorithm for the attribution problem. The model uses a k-order Markov representation
    to identify structural correlations in the customer journey data. The package also
    contains three heuristic algorithms (first-touch, last-touch and linear-touch approach)
    for the same problem. The algorithms are implemented in C++.
