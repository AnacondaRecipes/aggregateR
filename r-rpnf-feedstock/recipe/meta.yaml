  summary: A set of functions to analyze and print the development of a commodity using the Point
    and Figure (P&F) approach. A P&F processor can be used to calculate daily statistics
    for the time series. These statistics can be used for deeper investigations as well
    as to create plots. Plots can be generated as well known X/O Plots in plain text
    format, and additionally in a more graphical format.
