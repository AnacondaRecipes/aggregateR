  summary: Functions that compute rational approximations of fractional elliptic stochastic partial
    differential equations. The package also contains functions for common statistical
    usage of these approximations. The main references for rSPDE are Bolin, Simas and
    Xiong (2023) <doi:10.1080/10618600.2023.2231051> for the covariance-based method
    and Bolin and Kirchner (2020) <doi:10.1080/10618600.2019.1665537> for the operator-based
    rational approximation. These can be generated by the citation function in R.
