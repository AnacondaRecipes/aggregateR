  summary: 'This package provides utility functions for system command execution, both locally
    and remotely using ssh/scp. The command output is captured and provided to the caller.
    This functionality is intended to streamline calling shell commands from R, retrieving
    and using their output, while instrumenting the calls with appropriate error handling.
    NOTE: this first version is limited to unix with local and remote systems running
    bash as the default shell.'
