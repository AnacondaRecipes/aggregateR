  summary: Portable '/proc/self/maps' as a data frame. Determine which library or other region
    is mapped to a specific address of a process. -- R packages can contain native code,
    compiled to shared libraries at build or installation time. When loaded, each shared
    library occupies a portion of the address space of the main process. When only a
    machine instruction pointer is available (e.g. from a backtrace during error inspection
    or profiling), the address space map determines which library this instruction pointer
    corresponds to.
