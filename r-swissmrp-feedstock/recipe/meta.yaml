  summary: 'Provides a number of useful functions to employ MrP for small area prediction in
    Switzerland. Based on a hierarchical model and survey data one can derive cantonal
    preference measures. The package allows to automatize the prediction and post-stratification
    steps. It further provides adequate print, summary, map, and plot functions for
    objects of its class. '
