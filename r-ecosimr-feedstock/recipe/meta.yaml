  summary: 'Given a site by species interaction matrix, users can make inferences about species
    interactions by performance hypothesis comparing test statistics against a null
    distribution. The current package provides algorithms and metrics for niche-overlap,
    body size ratios and species co-occurrence. Users can also integrate their own algorithms
    and metrics within these frameworks or completely novel null models. Detailed explanations
    about the underlying assumptions of null model analysis in ecology can be found
    at http://ecosimr.org. '
