  summary: 'A variety of formulae are provided for estimation of physiologic characteristics
    of infants, children, and adults. Calculations include: body surface area, ideal
    weight, airway dead-space, the alveolar gas equation, and GFR.  Each formula is
    referenced to the original publication. Future functions will cover more material
    with a focus on anaesthesia, critical care and peri-operative medicine.'
