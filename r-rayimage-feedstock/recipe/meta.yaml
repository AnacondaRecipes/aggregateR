  summary: Uses convolution-based techniques to generate simulated camera bokeh, depth of field,
    and other camera effects, using an image and an optional depth map. Accepts both
    filename inputs and in-memory array representations of images and matrices. Includes
    functions to perform 2D convolutions, reorient and resize images/matrices, add image
    overlays, generate camera vignette effects, and add titles to images.
