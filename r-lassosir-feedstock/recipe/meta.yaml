  summary: Estimate the sufficient dimension reduction space using sparsed sliced inverse regression
    via Lasso (Lasso-SIR) introduced in Lin, Zhao, and Liu (2017) <arxiv:1611.06655>.
    The Lasso-SIR is consistent and achieve the optimal convergence rate under certain
    sparsity conditions for the multiple index models.
