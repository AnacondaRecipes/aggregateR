  summary: Allows to calculate the probabilities  of occurrences of an event in a great number
    of repetitions of Bernoulli experiment, through the application of the local and
    the integral theorem of De Moivre Laplace, and the theorem of Poisson. Gives the
    possibility to show the results graphically and analytically, and to compare the
    results obtained by the application of the above  theorems with those calculated
    by the direct application of the Binomial formula. Is basically useful for educational
    purposes.
