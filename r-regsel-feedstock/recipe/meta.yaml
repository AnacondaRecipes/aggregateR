  summary: Functions for fitting linear and generalized linear models with variable selection.
    The functions can automatically do Stepwise Regression, Lasso or Elastic Net as
    variable selection methods. Lasso and Elastic net are improved and handle factors
    better (they can either include or exclude all factor levels).
