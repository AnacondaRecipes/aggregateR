  summary: CLUster Evaluation (CLUE) is a computational method for identifying optimal number
    of clusters in a given time-course dataset clustered by cmeans or kmeans algorithms
    and subsequently identify key kinases or pathways from each cluster. Its implementation
    in R is called ClueR. See README on <https://github.com/PengyiYang/ClueR> for more
    details. P Yang et al. (2015) <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004403>.
