  summary: 'Provides functions for specifying and fitting nested dichotomy logistic regression
    models for a multi-category response and methods for summarising and plotting those
    models.  Nested dichotomies are statistically independent, and hence provide an
    additive decomposition of tests for the overall ''polytomous'' response.  When the
    dichotomies make sense substantively, this method can be a simpler alternative to
    the standard ''multinomial'' logistic model which compares response categories to
    a reference level.  See: J. Fox (2016), "Applied Regression Analysis and Generalized
    Linear Models", 3rd Ed., ISBN 1452205663.'
