  summary: A procedure for comparing multivariate samples associated with different groups. It
    uses principal component analysis to convert multivariate observations into a set
    of linearly uncorrelated statistical measures, which are then compared using a number
    of statistical methods. The procedure is independent of the distributional properties
    of samples and automatically selects features that best explain their differences,
    avoiding manual selection of specific points or summary statistics. It is appropriate
    for comparing samples of time series, images, spectrometric measures or similar
    multivariate observations. This package is described in Fachada et al. (2016) <doi:10.32614/RJ-2016-055>.
