  summary: Implementation of Forecastable Component Analysis ('ForeCA'), including main algorithms
    and auxiliary function (summary, plotting, etc.) to apply 'ForeCA' to multivariate
    time series data. 'ForeCA' is a novel dimension reduction (DR) technique for temporally
    dependent signals. Contrary to other popular DR methods, such as 'PCA' or 'ICA',
    'ForeCA' takes time dependency explicitly into account and searches for the most
    ''forecastable'' signal. The measure of forecastability is based on the Shannon
    entropy of the spectral density of the transformed signal.
