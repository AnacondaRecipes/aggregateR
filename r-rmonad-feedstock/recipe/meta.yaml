  summary: A monadic solution to pipeline analysis. All operations -- and the errors, warnings
    and messages they emit -- are merged into a directed graph. Infix binary operators
    mediate when values are stored, how exceptions are handled, and where pipelines
    branch and merge. The resulting structure may be queried for debugging or report
    generation. 'rmonad' complements, rather than competes with, non-monadic pipeline
    packages like 'magrittr' or 'pipeR'. This work is funded by the NSF (award number
    1546858).
