  summary: Forms a query to submit for US Treasury yield curve data, posting this query to the
    US Treasury web site's data feed service.  By default the download includes data
    yield data for 12 products from January 1, 1990, some of which are NA during this
    span.  The caller can pass parameters to limit the query to a certain year or year
    and month, but the full download is not especially large.  The download data from
    the service is in XML format.  The package's main function transforms that XML data
    into a numeric  data frame with treasury product items (constant maturity yields
    for 12 kinds  of bills, notes, and bonds) as columns and dates as row names. The
    function  returns a list which includes an item for this data frame as well as query-related
    values for reference and the update date from the service.
