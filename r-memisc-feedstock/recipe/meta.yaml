  summary: An infrastructure for the management of survey data including value labels, definable
    missing values, recoding of variables, production of code books, and import of (subsets
    of) 'SPSS' and 'Stata' files is provided. Further, the package allows to produce
    tables and data frames of arbitrary descriptive statistics and (almost) publication-ready
    tables of regression model estimates, which can be exported to 'LaTeX' and HTML.
