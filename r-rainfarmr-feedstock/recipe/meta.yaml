  summary: An implementation of the RainFARM (Rainfall Filtered Autoregressive Model) stochastic
    precipitation downscaling method (Rebora et al. (2006) <doi:10.1175/JHM517.1>).
    Adapted for climate downscaling according to D'Onofrio et al. (2018) <doi:10.1175/JHM-D-13-096.1>
    and for complex topography as in Terzago et al. (2018) <doi:10.5194/nhess-18-2825-2018>.
    The RainFARM method is based on the extrapolation to small scales of the Fourier
    spectrum of a large-scale precipitation field, using a fixed logarithmic slope and
    random phases at small scales, followed by a nonlinear transformation of the resulting
    linearly correlated stochastic field. RainFARM allows to generate ensembles of spatially
    downscaled precipitation fields which conserve precipitation at large scales and
    whose statistical properties are consistent with the small-scale statistics of observed
    precipitation, based only on knowledge of the large-scale precipitation field.
