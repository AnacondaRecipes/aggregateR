  summary: An R interface for the Java Machine Learning for Language Toolkit (mallet) <http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/>
    to estimate probabilistic topic models, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation. We
    can use the R package to read textual data into mallet from R objects, run the Java
    implementation of mallet directly in R, and extract results as R objects. The Mallet
    toolkit has many functions, this wrapper focuses on the topic modeling sub-package
    written by David Mimno. The package uses the rJava package to connect to a JVM.
