  summary: Implemented are various tests for semi-parametric repeated measures and general MANOVA
    designs that do neither assume multivariate normality nor covariance homogeneity,
    i.e., the procedures are applicable for a wide range of general multivariate factorial
    designs. In addition to asymptotic inference methods, novel bootstrap and permutation
    approaches are implemented as well. These provide more accurate results in case
    of small to moderate sample sizes. Furthermore, post-hoc comparisons are provided
    for the multivariate analyses. Friedrich, S., Konietschke, F. and Pauly, M. (2019)
