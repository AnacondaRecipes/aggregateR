  summary: Fit a bagging survival tree on a mixture of population (susceptible and nonsusceptible)
    using either a pseudo R2 criterion or an adjusted Logrank criterion. The predictor
    is  evaluated using the Out Of Bag Integrated Brier Score (IBS) and several scores
    of importance are computed for variable selection. The thresholds values for variable
    selection are  computed using a nonparametric permutation test.
