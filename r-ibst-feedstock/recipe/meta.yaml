  summary: Fit a full or subsampling bagging survival tree on a mixture of population (susceptible
    and nonsusceptible) using either a pseudo R2 criterion or an adjusted Logrank criterion.
    The predictor is evaluated using the Out Of Bag Integrated Brier Score (IBS) and
    several scores of importance are computed for variable selection. The thresholds
    values for variable selection are computed using a nonparametric permutation test.
