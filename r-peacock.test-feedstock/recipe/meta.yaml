  summary: 'The original definition of the two and three dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample
    test statistics given by Peacock (1983) is implemented. Two R-functions: peacock2
    and peacock3,  are provided to compute the test statistics in two and three dimensional
    spaces, respectively.  Note the Peacock test is different from the Fasano and Franceschini
    test (1987). The latter is  a variant of the Peacock test.'
