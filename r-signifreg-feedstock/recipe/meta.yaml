  summary: Provide consistent significance controlled variable selection procedure with different
    directions (forward, backward, stepwise) based on diverse criteria (AIC, BIC, adjusted
    r-square, and p-value). The algorithm selects a final model with only significant
    variables based on a correction choice of False Discovery Rate, Bonferroni, or no
    correction.
