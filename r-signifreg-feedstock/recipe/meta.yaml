  summary: Provides significance controlled variable selection algorithms with different directions
    (forward, backward, stepwise) based on diverse criteria (AIC, BIC, adjusted r-square,
    PRESS, or p-value). The algorithm selects a final model with only significant variables
    defined as those with significant p-values after multiple testing correction such
    as Bonferroni, False Discovery Rate, etc. See Zambom and Kim (2018) <doi:10.1002/sta4.210>.
