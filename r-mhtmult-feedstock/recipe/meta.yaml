  summary: A Comprehensive tool for almost all existing multiple testing methods for multiple
    families. The package summarizes the existing methods for multiple families multiple
    testing procedures (MTPs) such as double FDR, group Benjamini-Hochberg (GBH) procedure
    and average FDR controlling procedure. The package also provides some novel multiple
    testing procedures using selective inference idea.
