  summary: Provides an interface to 'vinecopulib', a C++ library for vine copula modeling. The
    'rvinecopulib' package implements the core features of the popular 'VineCopula'
    package, in particular inference algorithms for both vine copula and bivariate copula
    models. Advantages over 'VineCopula' are a sleeker and more modern API, improved
    performances, especially in high dimensions, nonparametric and multi-parameter families,
    and the ability to model discrete variables. The 'rvinecopulib' package includes
    'vinecopulib' as header-only C++ library (currently version 0.6.2). Thus users do
    not need to install 'vinecopulib' itself in order to use 'rvinecopulib'. Since their
    initial releases, 'vinecopulib' is licensed under the MIT License, and 'rvinecopulib'
    is licensed under the GNU GPL version 3.
