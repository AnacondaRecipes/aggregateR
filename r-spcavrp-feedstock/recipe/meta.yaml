  summary: Implements the SPCAvRP algorithm, developed and analysed in "Sparse principal component
    analysis via random projections" Gataric, M., Wang, T. and Samworth, R. J. (2018)
    <arXiv:1712.05630>. The algorithm is based on the aggregation of eigenvector information
    from carefully-selected random projections of the sample covariance matrix.
