  summary: The package "nparLD" is designed to perform nonparametric analysis of longitudinal
    data in factorial experiments. Longitudinal data are those which are collected from
    the same subjects over time, and they frequently arise in biological sciences. Nonparametric
    methods do not require distributional assumptions, and are applicable to a variety
    of data types (continuous, discrete, purely ordinal, and dichotomous).  Such methods
    are also robust with respect to outliers and for small sample sizes.
