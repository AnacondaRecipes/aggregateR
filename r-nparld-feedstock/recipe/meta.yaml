  summary: Performs nonparametric analysis of longitudinal data in factorial experiments. Longitudinal
    data are those which are collected from the same subjects over time, and they frequently
    arise in biological sciences. Nonparametric methods do not require distributional
    assumptions, and are applicable to a variety of data types (continuous, discrete,
    purely ordinal, and dichotomous).  Such methods are also robust with respect to
    outliers and for small sample sizes.
