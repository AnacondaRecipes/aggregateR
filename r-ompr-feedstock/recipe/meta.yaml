  summary: Model mixed integer linear programs in an algebraic way directly in R. The model is
    solver-independent and thus offers the possibility to solve a model with different
    solvers. It currently only supports linear constraints and objective functions.
    See the 'ompr' website <https://dirkschumacher.github.io/ompr/> for more information,
    documentation and examples.
