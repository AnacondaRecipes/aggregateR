  summary: 'Figures rendered on graphics devices are usually  rescaled to fit pre-determined
    device dimensions. ''plotscale''  implements the reverse: desired plot dimensions
    are specified  and device dimensions are calculated to accommodate marginal material,
    giving consistent proportions for plot elements. Default methods support grid graphics
    such as lattice and ggplot. See "example(''devsize'')" and "vignette(''plotscale'')".'
