  summary: The encoding of colour can be handled in many different ways, using different colour
    spaces. As different colour spaces have different uses, efficient conversion between
    these representations are important. The  'farver' package provides a set of functions
    that gives access to very fast colour space conversion and comparisons implemented
    in C++, and offers  100-fold speed improvements over the 'convertColor' function
    in the  'grDevices' package.
