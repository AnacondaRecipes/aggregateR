  summary: Utilities are provided which are of use in the packages I have developed for dealing
    with distributions. Currently these packages are GeneralizedHyperbolic, VarianceGamma,
    and SkewHyperbolic and NormalLaplace. Each of these packages requires DistributionUtils.
    Functionality includes sample skewness and kurtosis, log-histogram, tail plots,
    moments by integration, changing the point about which a moment is calculated, functions
    for testing distributions using inversion tests and the Massart inequality. Also
    includes an implementation of the incomplete Bessel K function.
