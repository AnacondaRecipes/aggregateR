  summary: The mature and widely-used C++ logging library 'spdlog' by Gabi Melman provides many
    desirable features. This package bundles these header files for easy use by R packages
    from both their R and C or C++ code. Explicit use via 'LinkingTo:' is also supported.
    Also see the 'spdl' package which enhanced this package with a consistent R and
    C++ interface.
