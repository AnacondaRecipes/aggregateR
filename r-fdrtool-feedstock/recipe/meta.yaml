  summary: Estimates both tail area-based false discovery rates (Fdr) as well as local false
    discovery rates (fdr) for a variety of null models (p-values, z-scores, correlation
    coefficients, t-scores).  The proportion of null values and the parameters of the
    null distribution are adaptively estimated from the data.  In addition, the package
    contains functions for non-parametric density estimation (Grenander estimator),
    for monotone regression (isotonic regression and antitonic regression with weights),
    for computing the greatest convex minorant (GCM) and the least concave majorant
    (LCM), for the half-normal and correlation distributions, and for computing empirical
    higher criticism (HC) scores and the corresponding decision threshold.
