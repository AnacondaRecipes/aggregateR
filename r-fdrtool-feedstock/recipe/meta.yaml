  summary: Estimates both tail area-based false  discovery rates (Fdr) as well as local false
    discovery rates (fdr) for a  variety of null models (p-values, z-scores, correlation
    coefficients, t-scores).  The proportion of null values and the parameters of the
    null  distribution are adaptively estimated from the data.  In addition, the package  contains
    functions for non-parametric density estimation (Grenander estimator),  for monotone
    regression (isotonic regression and antitonic regression with weights), for computing
    the greatest convex minorant (GCM) and the least concave majorant (LCM),  for the
    half-normal and correlation distributions, and for computing empirical higher criticism
    (HC) scores and the corresponding decision threshold.
