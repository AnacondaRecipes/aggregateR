  summary: The Swiss Ephemeris (version 2.08) is a high precision ephemeris based upon the DE431
    ephemerides from NASA's JPL. It covers the time range 13201 BCE to 17191 CE. This
    package uses the semi-analytic theory by Steve Moshier. For faster and more accurate
    calculations, the compressed Swiss Ephemeris data is available in the 'swephRdata'
    package. To access this data package, run 'install.packages("swephRdata", repos
    = "https://rstub.github.io/drat/", type = "source")'. The size of the 'swephRdata'
    package is approximately 115 MB. The user can also use the original JPL DE431 data.
