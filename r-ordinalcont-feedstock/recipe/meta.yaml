  summary: A regression framework for response variables which are continuous self-rating scales
    such as the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) used in pain assessment, or the Linear Analog
    Self-Assessment (LASA) scales in quality of life studies. These scales measure subjects'
    perception of an intangible quantity, and cannot be handled as ratio variables because
    of their inherent non-linearity. We treat them as ordinal variables, measured on
    a continuous scale. A function (the g function) connects the scale with an underlying
    continuous latent variable. The link function is the inverse of the CDF of the assumed
    underlying distribution of the latent variable. A variety of link functions are
    currently implemented.
