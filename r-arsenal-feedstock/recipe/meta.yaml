  summary: An Arsenal of 'R' functions for large-scale statistical summaries, which are streamlined
    to work within the latest reporting tools in 'R' and 'RStudio' and which use formulas
    and versatile summary statistics for summary tables and models. The primary functions
    include tableby(), a Table-1-like summary of multiple variable types 'by' the levels
    of one or more categorical variables; paired(), a Table-1-like summary of multiple
    variable types paired across two time points; modelsum(), which performs simple
    model fits on one or more endpoints for many variables (univariate or adjusted for
    covariates); freqlist(), a powerful frequency table across many categorical variables;
    comparedf(), a function for comparing data.frames; and write2(), a function to output
    tables to a document.
