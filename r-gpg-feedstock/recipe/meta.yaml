  summary: Bindings to GnuPG for working with OpenGPG (RFC4880) cryptographic methods. Includes
    utilities for public key encryption, creating and verifying digital signatures,
    and managing your local keyring. Some functionality depends on the version of GnuPG
    that is installed on the system. On Windows this package can be used together with
    'GPG4Win' which provides a GUI for managing keys and entering passphrases.
