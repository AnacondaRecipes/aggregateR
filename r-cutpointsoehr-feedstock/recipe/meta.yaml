  summary: Use optimal equal-HR method to determine two optimal cutpoints of a continuous predictor
    that has a U-shaped relationship with survival outcomes based on Cox regression
    model. The optimal equal-HR method estimates two optimal cut-points that have approximately
    the same log hazard value based on Cox regression model and divides individuals
    into different groups according to their HR values.
