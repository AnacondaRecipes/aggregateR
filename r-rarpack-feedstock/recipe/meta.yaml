  summary: Previously an R wrapper of the 'ARPACK' library <http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/>,
    and now a shell of the R package 'RSpectra', an R interface to the 'Spectra' library
    <http://yixuan.cos.name/spectra/> for solving large scale eigenvalue/vector problems.
    The current version of 'rARPACK' simply imports and exports the functions provided
    by 'RSpectra'. New users of 'rARPACK' are advised to switch to the 'RSpectra' package.
