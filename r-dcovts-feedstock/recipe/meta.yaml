  summary: Computing and plotting the distance covariance and correlation function of a univariate
    or a multivariate time series. Both versions of biased and unbiased estimators of
    distance covariance and correlation are provided. Test statistics for testing pairwise
    independence are also implemented.  Some data sets are also included.
