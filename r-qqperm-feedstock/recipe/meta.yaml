  summary: Provides users the necessary utility functions to generate permutation-based QQ plots
    and also estimate inflation factor based on the empirical NULL distribution. While
    it has general utility, it is particularly helpful when the skewness of the Fisher's
    Exact test in sparse data situations with imbalanced case-control sample sizes renders
    the reliance on the uniform chi-square expected distribution inappropriate.
