  summary: This package provides a variety of functions to analyze and model geostatistical count
    data with generalized linear spatial models, including 1) simulate and visualize
    the data; 2) posterior sampling with robust MCMC algorithms (in serial or parallel
    way); 3) perform prediction for unsampled locations; 4) conduct Bayesian model checking
    procedure to evaluate the goodness of fitting; 5) conduct transformed residual checking
    procedure. In the package, seamlessly embedded C++ programs and parallel computing
    techniques are implemented to speed up the computing processes.
