  summary: Two implementations of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) that are based on iterated
    regression. By choosing the appropriate regression algorithm for each data domain,
    it is possible to enforce sparsity, non-negativity or other kinds of constraints
    on the projection vectors. Multiple canonical variables are computed sequentially
    using a generalized deflation scheme, where the additional correlation not explained
    by previous variables is maximized. nscancor() is used to analyze paired data from
    two domains, and has the same interface as cancor() from the 'stats' package (plus
    some extra parameters). mcancor() is appropriate for analyzing data from three or
    more domains. See <https://sigg-iten.ch/learningbits/2014/01/20/canonical-correlation-analysis-under-constraints/>
    and Sigg et al. (2007) <doi:10.1109/MLSP.2007.4414315> for more details.
