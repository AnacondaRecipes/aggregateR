  summary: Provides a collection of commonly used univariate and multivariate time series forecasting
    models including automatically selected exponential smoothing (ETS) and autoregressive
    integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. These models work within the 'fable' framework
    provided by the 'fabletools' package, which provides the tools to evaluate, visualise,
    and combine models in a workflow consistent with the tidyverse.
