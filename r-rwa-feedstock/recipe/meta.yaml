  summary: Perform a Relative Weights Analysis (RWA) (a.k.a. Key Drivers Analysis) as per the
    method described in Tonidandel & LeBreton (2015) <DOI:10.1007/s10869-014-9351-z>,
    with its original roots in Johnson (2000) <DOI:10.1207/S15327906MBR3501_1>. In essence,
    RWA decomposes the total variance predicted in a regression model into weights that
    accurately reflect the proportional contribution of the predictor variables, which
    addresses the issue of multi-collinearity. In typical scenarios, RWA returns similar
    results to Shapley regression, but with a significant advantage on computational
    performance.
