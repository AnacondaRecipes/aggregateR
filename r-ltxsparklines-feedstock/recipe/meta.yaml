  summary: Sparklines are small plots (about one line of text high), made popular by Edward Tufte.  This
    package is the interface from R to the LaTeX package sparklines by Andreas Loeffer
    and Dan Luecking (<http://www.ctan.org/pkg/sparklines>).  It can work with Sweave
    or knitr or other engines that produce TeX.  The package can be used to plot vectors,
    matrices, data frames, time series (in ts or zoo format).
