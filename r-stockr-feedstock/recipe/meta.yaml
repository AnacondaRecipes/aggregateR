  summary: 'Provides a mixture model for clustering individuals (or sampling groups) into stocks
    based on their genetic profile. Here, sampling groups are individuals that are sure
    to come from the same stock (e.g. breeding adults or larvae). The mixture (log-)likelihood
    is maximised using the EM-algorithm after find good starting values via a K-means
    clustering of the genetic data. Details can be found in Foster, Feutry, Grewe, Berry,
    Hui, Davies (in press) Reliably Discriminating Stock Structure with Genetic Markers:
