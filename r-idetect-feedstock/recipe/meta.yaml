  summary: 'Provides efficient implementation of the Isolate-Detect methodology for the consistent
    estimation of the number and location of multiple  change-points in one-dimensional
    data sequences from the "deterministic  + noise" model. For details on the Isolate-Detect
    methodology, please see Anastasiou and Fryzlewicz (2018) <https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/24cdcc_6a0866c574654163b8255e272bc0001b.pdf>.
    Currently implemented scenarios are: piecewise-constant signal with Gaussian noise,
    piecewise-constant signal with heavy-tailed noise, continuous piecewise-linear  signal
    with Gaussian noise, continuous piecewise-linear signal with heavy-tailed noise.'
