  summary: The BACprior package provides an approximate sensitivity analysis of the  Bayesian
    Adjustment for Confounding (BAC) algorithm (Wang et al., 2012) with regards to the
    hyperparameter omega. The package also provides functions to guide the user in their
    choice of an appropriate omega value. The method is based on Lefebvre, Atherton
    and Talbot (2014).
