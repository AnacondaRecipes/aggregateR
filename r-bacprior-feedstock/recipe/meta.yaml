  summary: The Bayesian Adjustment for Confounding (BAC) algorithm (Wang et al., 2012) can be
    used to estimate the causal effect of a continuous exposure on a continuous outcome.
    This package provides an approximate sensitivity analysis of BAC with regards to
    the hyperparameter omega. BACprior also provides functions to guide the user in
    their choice of an appropriate omega value. The method is based on Lefebvre, Atherton
    and Talbot (2014).
