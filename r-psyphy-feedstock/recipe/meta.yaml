  summary: An assortment of functions that could be useful in analyzing data from psychophysical
    experiments. It includes functions for calculating d' from several different experimental
    designs, links for m-alternative forced-choice (mafc) data to be used with the binomial
    family in glm (and possibly other contexts) and self-Start functions for estimating
    gamma values for CRT screen calibrations.
