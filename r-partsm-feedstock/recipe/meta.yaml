  summary: 'This package performs basic functions to fit and predict periodic autoregressive
    time series models. These models are discussed in the book P.H. Franses (1996) "Periodicity
    and Stochastic Trends in Economic Time Series", Oxford University Press. Data set
    analyzed in that book is also provided. NOTE: the package was orphaned during several
    years. It is now only maintained, but no major enhancement are expected, and the
