  summary: Implements methods for centrality related analyses of networks. While the package
    includes the possibility to build more than 20 indices, its main focus lies on index-free
    assessment of centrality via partial rankings obtained by neighborhood-inclusion
    or positional dominance. These partial rankings can be analyzed with different methods,
    including probabilistic methods like computing expected node ranks and relative
    rank probabilities (how likely is it that a node is more central than another?).
    The methodology is described in depth in the vignettes and in Schoch (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.socnet.2017.12.003>.
