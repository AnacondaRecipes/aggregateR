  summary: Implements methods for centrality related analyses of networks.  While the package
    includes the possibility to build more than 20 indices,  its main focus lies on
    index-free assessment of centrality via partial  rankings obtained by neighborhood-inclusion
    or positional dominance. These  partial rankings can be analyzed with different
    methods, including  probabilistic methods like computing expected node ranks and
    relative  rank probabilities (how likely is it that a node is more central than
    another?). The methodology is described in depth in the vignettes and in Schoch
    (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.socnet.2017.12.003>.
