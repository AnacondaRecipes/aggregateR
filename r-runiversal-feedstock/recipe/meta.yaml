  summary: This package contains some functions for converting R objects to Java style variables
    and XML. Generated Java code is interpretable by dynamic Java libraries such as
    Beanshell. Calling R externally and handling the Java or XML output is an other
    way to call R from other languages without native interfaces. For a Java implementation
    of this approach visit http://www.mhsatman.com/rcaller.php and http://stdioe.blogspot.com/search/label/rcaller
