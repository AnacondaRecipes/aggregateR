  summary: Bayesian network structure learning, parameter learning and inference. This package
    implements constraint-based (PC, GS, IAMB, Inter-IAMB, Fast-IAMB, MMPC, Hiton-PC,
    HPC), pairwise (ARACNE and Chow-Liu), score-based (Hill-Climbing and Tabu Search)
    and hybrid (MMHC, RSMAX2, H2PC) structure learning algorithms for discrete, Gaussian
    and conditional Gaussian networks, along with many score functions and conditional
    independence tests. The Naive Bayes and the Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN) classifiers
    are also implemented. Some utility functions (model comparison and manipulation,
    random data generation, arc orientation testing, simple and advanced plots) are
    included, as well as support for parameter estimation (maximum likelihood and Bayesian)
    and inference, conditional probability queries, cross-validation, bootstrap and
    model averaging. Development snapshots with the latest bugfixes are available from
    <https://www.bnlearn.com/>.
