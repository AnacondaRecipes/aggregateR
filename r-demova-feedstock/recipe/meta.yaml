  summary: 'Tool for the development of multi-linear QSPR/QSAR models (Quantitative structure-property/activity
    relationship). Theses models are used in chemistry, biology and pharmacy to find
    a relationship between the structure of a molecule and its property (such as activity,
    toxicology but also physical properties). The various functions of this package
    allows: selection of descriptors based of variances, intercorrelation and user expertise;
    selection of the best multi-linear regression in terms of correlation and robustness;
    methods of internal validation (Leave-One-Out, Leave-Many-Out, Y-scrambling) and
    external using test sets.'
