  summary: 'This package allows to make inference on the properties of causal genetic variants
    in linkage disequilibrium with genotyped markers. In a first step,  we select a
    subset of variants using a score statistic for affected  sib-pairs. In a second
    step, on the selected subset, we make  inference on causal genetic variants in the
    considered region. '
