  summary: This package implements the adaptive mixed lasso (AML) method proposed by Wang et
    al.(2011).  AML applies adaptive lasso penalty to a large number of predictors,  thus
    producing a sparse model, while accounting for the population structure in the linear
    mixed model framework.  The package here is primarily designed for application to
    genome wide association studies or genomic prediction in plant breeding populations,
    though it could be applied to other settings of linear mixed models.
