  summary: Implements functions to update Bayesian Predictive Power Computations after not stopping
    a clinical trial at an interim analysis. Such an interim analysis can either be
    blinded or unblinded. Code is provided for Normally distributed endpoints with known
    variance, with a prominent example being the hazard ratio.
