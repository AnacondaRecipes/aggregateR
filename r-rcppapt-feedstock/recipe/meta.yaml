  summary: The 'APT Package Management System' provides Debian and Debian-derived Linux systems
    with a powerful system to resolve package dependencies. This package offers access
    directly from R.  This can only work on a system with a suitable 'libapt-pkg-dev'
    installation so functionality is curtailed if such a library is not found.
