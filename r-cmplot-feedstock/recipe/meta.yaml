  summary: Manhattan plot, a type of scatter plot, was widely used to display the association
    results. However, it is usually time-consuming and laborious for a non-specialist
    user to write scripts and adjust parameters of an elaborate plot. Moreover, the
    ever-growing traits measured have necessitated the  integration of results from
    different Genome-wide association study researches. Circle Manhattan Plot is the
    first open R package that can lay out  Genome-wide association study P-value results
    in both traditional rectangular patterns, QQ-plot and novel circular ones. United
    in only one bull's eye style  plot, association results from multiple traits can
    be compared interactively, thereby to reveal both similarities and differences between
    signals.
