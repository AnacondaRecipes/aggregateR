  summary: It is a complete suite to estimate models based on moment conditions. It includes
    the two step Generalized method of moments (Hansen 1982; <doi:10.2307/1912775>),
    the iterated GMM and continuous updated estimator (Hansen, Eaton and Yaron 1996;
    <doi:10.2307/1392442>) and several methods that belong to the Generalized Empirical
    Likelihood family of estimators (Smith 1997; <doi:10.1111/j.0013-0133.1997.174.x>,
    Kitamura 1997; <doi:10.1214/aos/1069362388>, Newey and Smith 2004; <doi:10.1111/j.1468-0262.2004.00482.x>,
