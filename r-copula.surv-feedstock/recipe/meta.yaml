  summary: Perform association analysis of bivariate survival data based on copula models. Two
    different ways to estimate the association parameter in copula models are implemented.
    A goodness-of-fit test for a given copula model is implemented. See Emura, Lin and
    Wang (2010) <doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2010.03.013> for details.
