  summary: Cobb's maximum likelihood method for cusp-catastrophe modeling (Grasman, van der Maas,
    and Wagenmakers (2009) <doi:10.18637/jss.v032.i08>; Cobb (1981), Behavioral Science,
    26(1), 75-78). Includes a cusp() function for model fitting, and several utility
    functions for plotting, and for comparing the model to linear regression and logistic
    curve models.
