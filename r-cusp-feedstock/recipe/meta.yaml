  summary: Cobb's maximum likelihood method for cusp-catastrophe modeling (Grasman, van der Maas,
    & Wagenmakers, 2009, JSS, 32:8; Cobb, L, 1981, Behavioral Science, 26:1, 75--78).
    Includes a cusp() function for model fitting, and several utility functions for
    plotting, and for comparing the model to linear regression and logistic curve models.
