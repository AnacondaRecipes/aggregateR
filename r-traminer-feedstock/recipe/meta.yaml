  summary: Set of sequence analysis tools for manipulating, describing and rendering categorical
    sequences, and more generally mining sequence data in the field of social sciences.
    Although this sequence analysis package is primarily intended for state or event
    sequences that describe time use or life courses such as family formation histories
    or professional careers, its features also apply to many other kinds of categorical
    sequence data. It accepts many different sequence representations as input and provides
    tools for converting sequences from one format to another. It offers several functions
    for describing and rendering sequences, for computing distances between sequences
    with different metrics (among which optimal matching), original dissimilarity-based
    analysis tools, and functions for extracting the most frequent event subsequences
    and identifying the most discriminating ones among them. A user's guide can be found
    on the TraMineR web page.
