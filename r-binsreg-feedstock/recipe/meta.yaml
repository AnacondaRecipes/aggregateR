  summary: Provides tools for statistical analysis using the binscatter methods developed by
    Cattaneo, Crump, Farrell and Feng (2023a) <arXiv:1902.09608>, Cattaneo, Crump, Farrell
    and Feng (2023b) <https://nppackages.github.io/references/Cattaneo-Crump-Farrell-Feng_2023_NonlinearBinscatter.pdf>
    and Cattaneo, Crump, Farrell and Feng (2023c) <arXiv:1902.09615>. Binscatter provides
    a flexible way of describing the relationship between two variables based on partitioning/binning
    of the independent variable of interest. binsreg(), binsqreg() and binsglm() implement
    binscatter least squares regression, quantile regression and generalized linear
    regression respectively, with particular focus on constructing binned scatter plots.
    They also implement robust (pointwise and uniform) inference of regression functions
    and derivatives thereof. binstest() implements hypothesis testing procedures for
    parametric functional forms of and nonparametric shape restrictions on the regression
    function. binspwc() implements hypothesis testing procedures for pairwise group
    comparison of binscatter estimators. binsregselect() implements data-driven procedures
    for selecting the number of bins for binscatter estimation. All the commands allow
    for covariate adjustment, smoothness restrictions and clustering.
