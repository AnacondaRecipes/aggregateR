  summary: 'Genetic predisposition for complex traits is often manifested through multiple tissues
    of interest at different time points in the development. As an example, the genetic
    predisposition for obesity could be manifested through inherited variants that control
    metabolism through regulation of genes expressed in the brain and/or through the
    control of fat storage in the adipose tissue by dysregulation of genes expressed
    in adipose tissue. We present a method eGST (eQTL-based genetic subtyper) that integrates
    tissue-specific eQTLs with GWAS data for a complex trait to probabilistically assign
    a tissue of interest to the phenotype of each individual in the study. eGST estimates
    the posterior probability that an individual''s phenotype can be assigned to a tissue
    based on individual-level genotype data of tissue-specific eQTLs and marginal phenotype
    data in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) cohort. Under a Bayesian framework
    of mixture model, eGST employs a maximum a posteriori (MAP) expectation-maximization
    (EM) algorithm to estimate the tissue-specific posterior probability across individuals.
