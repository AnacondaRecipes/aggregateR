  summary: This is an R implementation of "A Fast and Scalable Joint Estimator for Learning Multiple
    Related Sparse Gaussian Graphical Models" (FASJEM). The FASJEM algorithm can be
    used to estimate multiple related precision matrices. For instance, it can identify
    context-specific gene networks from multi-context gene expression datasets. By performing
    data-driven network inference from high-dimensional and heterogonous data sets,
    this tool  can help users effectively translate aggregated data into knowledge that
    take the form of graphs among entities. Please run demo(fasjem) to learn the basic
    functions provided by this package. For more details, please see <http://proceedings.mlr.press/v54/wang17e/wang17e.pdf>.
