  summary: 'Tools for creating and visualizing statistical process control charts. Control charts
    are used for monitoring measurement processes, such as those occurring in manufacturing.  The
    objective is to monitor the history of such processes and flag outlying measurements:
    out-of-control signals.  Montgomery, D. (2009, ISBN:978-0-470-16992-6) contains
    an extensive discussion of the methodology.'
