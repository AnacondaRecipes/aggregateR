  summary: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a computational method that determines whether
    an a priori defined set of genes shows statistically significant, concordant differences
    between two biological states. The original algorithm is detailed in Subramanian
    et al. with 'Java' implementations available through the Broad Institute (Subramanian
    et al. 2005 <doi:10.1073/pnas.0506580102>). The 'liger' package provides a lightweight
    R implementation of this enrichment test on a list of values (Fan et al., 2017 <doi:10.5281/zenodo.887386>).
    Given a list of values, such as p-values or log-fold changes derived from differential
    expression analysis or other analyses comparing biological states, this package
    enables you to test a priori defined set of genes for enrichment to enable interpretability
    of highly significant or high fold-change genes.
