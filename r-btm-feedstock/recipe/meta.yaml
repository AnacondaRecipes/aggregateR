  summary: Biterm Topic Models find topics in collections of short texts. It is a word co-occurrence
    based topic model that learns topics by modeling word-word co-occurrences patterns
    which are called biterms. This in contrast to traditional topic models like Latent
    Dirichlet Allocation and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis which are word-document
    co-occurrence topic models. A biterm consists of two words co-occurring in the same
    short text window. This context window can for example be a twitter message, a short
    answer on a survey, a sentence of a text or a document identifier. The techniques
    are explained in detail in the paper 'A Biterm Topic Model For Short Text' by Xiaohui
    Yan, Jiafeng Guo, Yanyan Lan, Xueqi Cheng (2013) <https://github.com/xiaohuiyan/xiaohuiyan.github.io/blob/master/paper/BTM-WWW13.pdf>.
