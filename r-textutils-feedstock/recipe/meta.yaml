  summary: Utilities for handling character vectors that store human-readable text (either plain
    or with markup, such as HTML or LaTeX). The package provides, in particular, functions
    that help with the preparation of plain-text reports (e.g. for expanding and aligning
    strings that form the lines of such reports); the package also provides generic
    functions for transforming R objects to HTML and to plain text.
