  summary: A different way for calculating pdf/pmf, cdf, quantile and random data such that the
    user is able to consider the name of related distribution as an argument and so
    easily can changed by a changing argument by user. It must be mentioned that the
    core and computation base of package 'DISTRIB' is package 'stats'. Although similar
    functions are introduced previously in package 'stats', but the package 'DISTRIB'
    has some special applications in some special computational programs.
