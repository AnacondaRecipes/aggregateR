  summary: 'Functions for nonlinear time series analysis. This package permits the computation
    of the  most-used nonlinear statistics/algorithms including generalized correlation
    dimension, information dimension, largest Lyapunov exponent, sample entropy and
    Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA), among others. Basic routines for surrogate
    data testing are also included. Part of this work was based on the  book "Nonlinear
    time series analysis" by Holger Kantz and Thomas Schreiber (ISBN: 9780521529020).'
