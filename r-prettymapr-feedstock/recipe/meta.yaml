  summary: Automates the process of creating a scale bar and north arrow in any package that
    uses base graphics to plot in R. Bounding box tools help find and manipulate extents.
    Finally, there is a function to automate the process of setting margins, plotting
    the map, scale bar, and north arrow, and resetting graphic parameters upon completion.
