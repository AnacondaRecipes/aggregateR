  summary: Functions, methods, and datasets for fitting dimension reduction regression, using
    slicing (methods SAVE and SIR), Principal Hessian Directions (phd, using residuals
    and the response), and an iterative IRE.  Partial methods, that condition on categorical
    predictors are also available.  A variety of tests, and stepwise deletion of predictors,
    is also included.  Also included is code for computing permutation tests of dimension.  Adding
    additional methods of estimating dimension is straightforward. For documentation,
    see the vignette in the package.   With version 3.0.4, the arguments for dr.step
    have been modified.
