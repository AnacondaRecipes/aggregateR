  summary: In putative Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs) identification from sequence/alignments,
    we are interested in the significance of certain match score. TFMPvalue provides
    the accurate calculation of P-value with score threshold for Position Weight Matrices,
    or the score with given P-value. It is an interface to code originally made available
    by Helene Touzet and Jean-Stephane Varre, 2007, Algorithms Mol Biol:2, 15. <doi:10.1186/1748-7188-2-15>.
