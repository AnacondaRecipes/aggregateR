  summary: Provide tools for finding multiple-objective optimal designs for estimating the shape
    of dose-response, the ED50 (the dose producing an effect midway between the expected
    responses at the extreme doses) and the MED (the minimum effective dose level) for
    the 2,3,4-parameter logistic models and for evaluating its efficiencies for the
    three objectives. The acronym VNM stands for V-algorithm using Newton Raphson method
    to search multiple-objective optimal design.
