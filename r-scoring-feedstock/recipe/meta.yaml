  summary: Evaluating probabilistic forecasts via proper scoring rules.  scoring implements the
    beta, power, and pseudospherical families of proper scoring rules, along with ordered
    versions of the latter two families.  Included among these families are popular
    rules like the Brier (quadratic) score, logarithmic score, and spherical score.  For
    two-alternative forecasts, also includes functionality for plotting scores that
    one would obtain under specific scoring rules.
