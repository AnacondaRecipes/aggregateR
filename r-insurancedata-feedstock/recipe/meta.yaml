  summary: Insurance datasets, which are often used in claims severity and claims frequency modelling.
    It helps testing new regression models in those problems, such as GLM, GLMM, HGLM,
    non-linear mixed models etc. Most of the data sets are applied in the project "Mixed
    models in ratemaking" supported by grant NN 111461540 from Polish National Science
    Center.
