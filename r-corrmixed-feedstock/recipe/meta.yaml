  summary: In clinical practice and research settings in medicine and the behavioral sciences,
    it is often of interest to quantify the correlation of a continuous endpoint that
    was repeatedly measured (e.g., test-retest correlations, ICC, etc.). This package
    allows for estimating these correlations based on mixed-effects models. Part of
    this software has been developed using funding provided from the European Union's
    7th Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration
    under Grant Agreement no 602552.
