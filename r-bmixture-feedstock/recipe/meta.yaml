  summary: Provides statistical tools for Bayesian estimation for finite mixture of distributions,
    mainly mixture of Gamma, Normal and t-distributions. The package is implemented
    the recent improvements in Bayesian literature for the finite mixture of distributions,
    including Mohammadi and et al. (2013) <doi:10.1007/s00180-012-0323-3> and Mohammadi
