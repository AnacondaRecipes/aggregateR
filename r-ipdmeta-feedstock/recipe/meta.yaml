  summary: This package provides functions to estimate an IPD linear mixed effects model for
    a continuous outcome and any categorical covariate from study summary statistics.
    There are also functions for estimating the power of a treatment-covariate interaction
    test in an individual patient data meta-analysis from aggregate data.
