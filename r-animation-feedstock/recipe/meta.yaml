  summary: Provides functions for animations in statistics, covering topics in probability theory,
    mathematical statistics, multivariate statistics, non-parametric statistics, sampling
    survey, linear models, time series, computational statistics, data mining and machine
    learning. These functions may be helpful in teaching statistics and data analysis.
    Also provided in this package are a series of functions to save animations to various
    formats, e.g. Flash, 'GIF', HTML pages, 'PDF' and videos. 'PDF' animations can be
    inserted into 'Sweave' / 'knitr' easily.
