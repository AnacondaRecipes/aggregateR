  summary: Implements multiple imputation of missing covariates by Substantive Model Compatible
    Fully Conditional Specification. This is a modification of the popular FCS/chained
    equations multiple imputation approach, and allows imputation of missing covariate
    values from models which are compatible with the user specified substantive model.
