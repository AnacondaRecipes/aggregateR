  summary: Analysis of corneal data obtained from a Placido disk corneal  topographer with calculation
    of irregularity indices. A corneal topographer is  an ophthalmic clinical device
    that obtains measurements in the cornea (the anterior  part of the eye). A Placido
    disk corneal topographer makes use of the Placido disk  (Rowsey et al. (1981), <doi:10.1001/archopht.1981.03930011093022>,
    Rand et al. (1997), <doi:10.1016/S0886-3350(99)00355-7>), which produce a circular
    pattern of measurement nodes. The raw information measured by such a topographer
    is  used by practitioners to analyze curvatures, to study optical aberrations, or
    to diagnose specific conditions of the eye. The rPACI package allows the  calculation
    of the corneal irregularity indices described in Ramos-Lopez et al. (2013), <doi:10.1097/OPX.0b013e3182843f2a>,
    and that were firstly introduced in Ramos-Lopez et al. (2011), <doi:10.1097/OPX.0b013e3182843f2a>.
    It provides a  simple interface to read corneal topography data files as exported
    by a typical Placido disk topographer, to compute the irregularity indices mentioned
    before, and to display summary plots that are easy to interpret for a clinician.
