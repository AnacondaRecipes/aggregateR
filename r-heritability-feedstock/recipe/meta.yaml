  summary: Implements marker-based estimation of heritability when observations on genetically
    identical replicates are available. These can be either observations on individual
    plants or plot-level data in a field trial. Heritability can then be estimated using
    a mixed model for the individual plant or plot data. For comparison, also mixed-model
    based estimation using genotypic means and estimation of repeatability with ANOVA
    are implemented. For illustration the package contains several datasets for the
    model species Arabidopsis thaliana.
