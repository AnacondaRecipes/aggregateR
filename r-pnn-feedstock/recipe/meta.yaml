  summary: The program pnn implements the algorithm proposed by Specht (1990).  It is written
    in the R statistical language. It solves a common problem in automatic learning.
    Knowing a set of observations described by a vector of quantitative variables, we
    classify them in a given number of groups. Then, the algorithm is trained with this
    datasets and should guess afterwards the group of any new observation. This neural
    network has the main advantage to begin generalization instantaneously even with
    a small set of known observations. It is delivered with four functions (learn, smooth,
    perf and guess) and a dataset. The functions are documented with examples and provided
    with unit tests.
