  summary: The breakfast package performs multiple change-point detection in data sequences,
    or sequence segmentation, using computationally efficient multiscale methods. This
    version of the package implements the "Tail-Greedy Unbalanced Haar", "Wild Binary
    Segmentation" and "Adaptive Wild Binary Segmentation" change-point detection and
    segmentation methodologies. To start with, see the function segment.mean.
