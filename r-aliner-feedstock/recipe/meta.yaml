  summary: Functions are provided to calculate the 'ALINE' Distance between words as per  (Kondrak
    2000) and (Downey, Hallmark, Cox, Norquest, & Lansing, 2008,  <doi:10.1080/09296170802326681>).
    The score is based on phonetic features represented  using the Unicode-compliant
    International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). Parameterized  features weights are used
    to determine the optimal alignment and functions are provided to estimate optimum
    values using a genetic algorithm and supervised  learning. See (Downey, Sun, and
    Norquest 2017,  <https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-005/index.html>.
