  summary: The main function of this package allows numerical vector objects to be displayed
    with their values in vulgar fractional form.  This is convenient if patterns can
    then be more easily detected.  In some cases replacing the components of a numeric
    vector by a rational approximation can also be expected to remove some component
    of round-off error.  The main functions form a re-implementation of the functions
    'fractions' and 'rational' of the MASS package, but using a radically improved programming
    strategy.
