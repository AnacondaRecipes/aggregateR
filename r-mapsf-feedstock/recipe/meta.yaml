  summary: Create and integrate thematic maps in your workflow. This package helps to design
    various cartographic representations such as proportional symbols, choropleth or
    typology maps. It also offers several functions to display layout elements that
    improve the graphic presentation of maps (e.g. scale bar, north arrow, title, labels).
    'mapsf' maps 'sf' objects on 'base' graphics.
