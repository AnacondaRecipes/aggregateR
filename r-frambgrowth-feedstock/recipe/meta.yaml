  summary: 'Generation of theoretical size distributions of framboidal or sunflower pyrite.  The
    growth mechanisms used are surface and supply controlled and dependent or independent

    the R-package frambgrowth" The authors Merinero, R., and Cardenes, V. (2018). <DOI:10.1007/s00710-017-0535-x>.'
