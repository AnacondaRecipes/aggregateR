  summary: Build and manipulate probability distributions of the skew-normal family and some
    related ones, notably the skew-t and the SUN families. For the skew-normal and the
    skew-t distributions, statistical methods are provided for data fitting and model
    diagnostics, in the univariate and the multivariate case.
