  summary: Performs adjustments of a user-supplied independence loglikelihood function using
    a robust sandwich estimator of the parameter covariance matrix, based on the methodology
    in Chandler and Bate (2007) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asm015>.  This can be used for cluster
    correlated data when interest lies in the parameters of the marginal distributions
    or for performing inferences that are robust to certain types of model misspecification.  Functions
    for profiling the adjusted loglikelihoods are also provided, as are functions for
    calculating and plotting confidence intervals, for single model parameters, and
    confidence regions, for pairs of model parameters.  Nested models can be compared
    using an adjusted likelihood ratio test.
