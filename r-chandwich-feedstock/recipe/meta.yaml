  summary: Performs adjustments of a user-supplied independence loglikelihood  function using
    a robust sandwich estimator of the parameter covariance  matrix, based on the methodology
    in Chandler and Bate (2007)  <doi:10.1093/biomet/asm015>.  This can be used for
    cluster correlated data  when interest lies in the parameters of the marginal distributions
    or for  performing inferences that are robust to certain types of model  misspecification.  Functions
    for profiling the adjusted loglikelihoods are  also provided, as are functions for
    calculating and plotting confidence  intervals, for single model parameters, and
    confidence regions, for pairs  of model parameters.  Nested models can be compared
    using an adjusted  likelihood ratio test.
