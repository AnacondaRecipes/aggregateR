  summary: A unified interface is provided to various machine learning algorithms like linear
    or quadratic discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, support
    vector machine, ... It allows to train, test, and apply cross-validation using similar
    functions and function arguments with a minimalist and clean, formula-based interface.
    Missing data are processed the same way as base and stats R functions for all algorithms,
    both in training and testing. Confusion matrices are also provided with a rich set
    of metrics calculated and a few specific plots.
