  summary: A unified interface is provided to various machine learning algorithms like LDA, QDA,
    k-nearest neighbour, LVQ, random forest, SVM, ... It allows to train, test, and
    apply cross-validation using similar functions and function arguments with a minimalist
    and clean, formula-based interface. Missing data are threated the same way as base
    and stats R functions for all algorithms, both in training and testing. Confusion
    matrices are also provided with a rich set of metrics calculated and a few specific
    plots.
