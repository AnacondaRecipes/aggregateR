  summary: 'Allows estimation and modelling of flight costs in animal (vertebrate) flight, implementing
    the aerodynamic power model described in Klein Heerenbrink et al. (2015) <doi:10.1098/rspa.2014.0952>.
    Taking inspiration from the program ''Flight'', developed by Colin Pennycuick (Pennycuick
    (2008) "Modelling the flying bird". Amsterdam: Elsevier. ISBN 0-19-857721-4), flight
    performance is estimated based on basic morphological measurements such as body
    mass, wingspan and wing area. ''afpt'' can be used to make predictions on how animals
    should adjust their flight behaviour and wingbeat kinematics to varying flight conditions.'
