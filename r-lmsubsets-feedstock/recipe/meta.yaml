  summary: Exact and approximation algorithms for variable-subset selection in ordinary linear
    regression models.  Either compute all submodels with the lowest residual sum of
    squares, or determine the single-best submodel according to a pre-determined statistical
    criterion.  Hofmann, Gatu, Kontoghiorghes, Colubi, Zeileis (2018, submitted).
