  summary: Treelets provides a novel construction of multi-scale bases that extends wavelets
    to non-smooth signals. It returns a multi-scale orthonormal basis, where the final
    computed basis functions are supported on nested clusters in a hierarchical tree.  Both
    the tree and the basis, which are constructed simultaneously, reflect the internal
    structure of the data.
