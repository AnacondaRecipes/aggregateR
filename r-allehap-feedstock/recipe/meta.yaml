  summary: Tools to simulate alphanumeric alleles, impute genetic missing data and reconstruct
    non-recombinant haplotypes from pedigree databases in a deterministic way. Allelic
    simulations can be implemented taking into account many factors (such as number
    of families, markers, alleles per marker, probability and proportion of missing
    genotypes, recombination rate, etc). Genotype imputation can be used with simulated
    datasets or real databases (previously loaded in .ped format). Haplotype reconstruction
    can be carried out even with missing data, since the program firstly imputes each
    family genotype (without a reference panel), to later reconstruct the corresponding
    haplotypes for each family member. All this considering that each individual (due
    to meiosis) should unequivocally have two alleles per marker (one inherited from
    each parent) and thus imputation and reconstruction results can be deterministically
    calculated.
