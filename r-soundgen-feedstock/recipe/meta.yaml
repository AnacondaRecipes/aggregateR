  summary: 'Performs parametric synthesis of sounds with harmonic and noise components such as
    animal vocalizations or human voice. Also offers tools for audio manipulation and
    acoustic analysis, including pitch tracking, spectral analysis, audio segmentation,
    pitch and formant shifting, etc. Includes four interactive web apps for synthesizing
    and annotating audio, manually correcting pitch contours, and measuring formant
    frequencies. Reference: Anikin (2019) <doi:10.3758/s13428-018-1095-7>.'
