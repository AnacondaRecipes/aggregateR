  license: MIT
  summary: Implementations of a large number of tests for symmetry and their bootstrap variants,
    which can be used for testing the symmetry of random samples around a known or unknown
    mean. Functions are also there for testing the symmetry of model residuals around
    zero. Currently, the supported models are linear models and generalized autoregressive
    conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models (fitted with the 'fGarch' package).
    All tests are implemented using the 'Rcpp' package which ensures great performance
    of the code.
