  summary: Calculates graph theoretic scagnostics.  Scagnostics describe various measures of
    interest for pairs of variables, based on their appearance on a scatterplot.  They
    are useful tool for discovering interesting or unusual scatterplots from a scatterplot
    matrix, without having to look at every individual plot.
