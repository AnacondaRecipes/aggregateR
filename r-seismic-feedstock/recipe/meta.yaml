  summary: An implementation of self-exciting point process model for information cascades, which
    occurs when many people engage in the same acts after observing the actions of others
    (e.g. post resharings on Facebook or Twitter). It provides functions to estimate
    the infectiousness of an information cascade and predict its popularity given the
    observed history. See http://snap.stanford.edu/seismic/ for more information and
    datasets.
