  summary: 'Compute the repeated measures correlation, a statistical technique for determining
    the overall within-individual relationship among paired measures assessed on two
    or more occasions, first introduced by Bland and Altman (1995). Includes functions
    for diagnostics, p-value, effect size with confidence interval including optional
    bootstrapping, as well as graphing. Also includes several example datasets. For
