  summary: Uses a slice sampling-based Markov chain Monte Carlo to conduct Bayesian fitting and
    inference for generalized additive mixed models.  Generalized linear mixed models
    and generalized  additive models are also handled as special cases of generalized
    additive mixed models. The methodology and software is described  in Pham, T.H.
    and Wand, M.P. (2018). Australian and New Zealand Journal of Statistics, 60, 279-330
