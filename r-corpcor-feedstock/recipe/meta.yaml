  summary: Implements a James-Stein-type shrinkage estimator for  the covariance matrix, with
    separate shrinkage for variances and correlations.   The details of the method are
    explained in Schafer and Strimmer (2005)  <DOI:10.2202/1544-6115.1175> and Opgen-Rhein
    and Strimmer (2007)  <DOI:10.2202/1544-6115.1252>.  The approach is both computationally
    as well as statistically very efficient, it is applicable to "small n, large p"
    data,  and always returns a positive definite and well-conditioned covariance matrix.   In
    addition to inferring the covariance matrix the package also provides  shrinkage
    estimators for partial correlations and partial variances.   The inverse of the
    covariance and correlation matrix  can be efficiently computed, as well as any arbitrary
    power of the  shrinkage correlation matrix.  Furthermore, functions are available
    for fast  singular value decomposition, for computing the pseudoinverse, and for  checking
    the rank and positive definiteness of a matrix.
