  license: GPL-3
  summary: Contains functions to perform Bayesian inference using posterior simulation for a
    number of statistical models. Most simulation is done in compiled C++ written in
    the Scythe Statistical Library Version 1.0.3. All models return 'coda' mcmc objects
    that can then be summarized using the 'coda' package. Some useful utility functions
    such as density functions, pseudo-random number generators for statistical distributions,
    a general purpose Metropolis sampling algorithm, and tools for visualization are
    provided.
