  summary: Provides methods for working with nominal dates, times, and  durations. Base R has
    sophisticated facilities for handling time, but these  can give unexpected results
    if, for example, timezone is not handled properly.  This package provides a more
    casual approach to support cases which  do not require rigorous treatment.  It systematically
    deconstructs the  concepts origin and timezone, and de-emphasizes the display of
    seconds. It  also converts among nominal durations such as seconds, hours, days,
    and weeks. See '?datetime' and '?duration' for examples. Adapted from 'metrumrg'  <http://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=1215>.
