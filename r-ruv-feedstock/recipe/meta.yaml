  summary: Implements the 'RUV' (Remove Unwanted Variation) algorithms.  These algorithms attempt
    to adjust for systematic errors of unknown origin in high-dimensional data.  The
    algorithms were originally developed for use with genomic data, especially microarray
    data, but may be useful with other types of high-dimensional data as well.  These
    algorithms were proposed in Gagnon-Bartsch and Speed (2012) <doi:10.1093/nar/gkz433>,
    Gagnon-Bartsch, Jacob and Speed (2013), and Molania, et. al. (2019) <doi:10.1093/nar/gkz433>.  The
    algorithms require the user to specify a set of negative control variables, as described
    in the references.  The algorithms included in this package are 'RUV-2', 'RUV-4',
    'RUV-inv', 'RUV-rinv', 'RUV-I', and RUV-III', along with various supporting algorithms.
