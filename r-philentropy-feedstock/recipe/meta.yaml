  summary: Computes 46 optimized distance and similarity measures for comparing probability functions
    (Drost (2018) <doi:10.21105/joss.00765>). These comparisons between probability
    functions have their foundations in a broad range of scientific disciplines from
    mathematics to ecology. The aim of this package is to provide a core framework for
    clustering, classification, statistical inference, goodness-of-fit, non-parametric
    statistics, information theory, and machine learning tasks that are based on comparing
    univariate or multivariate probability functions.
