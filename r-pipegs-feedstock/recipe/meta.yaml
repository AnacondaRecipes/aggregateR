  summary: Code for various permutation p-values estimation methods for gene set test. The description
    of corresponding methods can be found in the dissertation of Yu He(2016) "Efficient
    permutation P-value estimation for gene set tests" <https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/11849351>.
    One of the methods also corresponds to the paper "Permutation p-value approximation
    via generalized Stolarsky invariance" <arXiv:1603.02757>.
