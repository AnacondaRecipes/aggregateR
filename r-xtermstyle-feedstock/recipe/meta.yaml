  summary: Can be used for coloring output in terminals. It was developed for the standard Ubuntu
    terminal but should be compatible with any terminal using xterm or ANSI escape sequences.
    If run in windows, RStudio, or any other platform not supporting such escape sequences
    it gracefully passes on any output without modifying it.
