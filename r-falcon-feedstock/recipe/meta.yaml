  summary: This is a method for Allele-specific DNA Copy Number Profiling using Next-Generation
    Sequencing.  Given the allele-specific coverage at the variant loci, this program
    segments the genome into regions of homogeneous allele-specific copy number.  It
    requires, as input, the read counts for each variant allele in a pair of case and
    control samples. For detection of somatic mutations, the case and control samples
    can be the tumor and normal sample from the same individual.
