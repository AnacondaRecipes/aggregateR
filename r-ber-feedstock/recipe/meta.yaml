  summary: The functions in this package remove batch effects from microarrary normalized data.
    The expression levels of the genes are represented in a matrix where rows correspond
    to independent samples and columns to genes (variables). The batches are represented
    by categorical variables (objects of class factor). When further covariates of interest
    are available they can be used to remove efficiently the batch effects and adjust
    the data.
