  summary: 'Approaches for incorporating time into network analysis. Methods include: construction
    of time-ordered networks (temporal graphs); shortest-time and shortest-path-length
    analyses; resource spread calculations; data resampling and rarefaction for null
    model construction; reduction to time-aggregated networks with variable window sizes;
    application of common descriptive statistics to these networks; vector clock latencies;
    and plotting functionalities. The package supports <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0020298>. '
