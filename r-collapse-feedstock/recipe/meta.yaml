  summary: A C/C++ based package for advanced data transformation and statistical computing in
    R that is extremely fast, class-agnostic, robust and programmer friendly. Core functionality
    includes a rich set of S3 generic grouped and weighted statistical functions for
    vectors, matrices and data frames, which provide efficient low-level vectorizations,
    OpenMP multithreading, and skip missing values by default. These are integrated
    with fast grouping and ordering algorithms (also callable from C), and efficient
    data manipulation functions. The package also provides a flexible and rigorous approach
    to time series and panel data in R. It further includes fast functions for common
    statistical procedures, detailed (grouped, weighted) summary statistics, powerful
    tools to work with nested data, fast data object conversions, functions for memory
    efficient R programming, and helpers to effectively deal with variable labels, attributes,
    and missing data. It is well integrated with base R classes, 'dplyr'/'tibble', 'data.table',
    'sf', 'plm' (panel-series and data frames), and 'xts'/'zoo'.
