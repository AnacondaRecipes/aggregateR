  summary: A C/C++ based package for advanced data transformation and statistical computing in
    R that is extremely fast, class-agnostic, and programmer friendly through a flexible
    and robust API. Core functionality includes a rich set of S3 generic grouped and
    weighted statistical functions for vectors, matrices and data frames, which provide
    efficient low-level vectorizations, OpenMP multithreading, and skip missing values
    by default. These are integrated with fast grouping and ordering algorithms (also
    callable from C), and efficient data manipulation functions. The package also provides
    a flexible and rigorous approach to time series and panel data in R. It further
    includes fast functions for common statistical procedures, detailed (grouped, weighted)
    summary statistics, powerful tools to work with nested data, fast data object conversions,
    functions for memory efficient R programming, and helpers to effectively deal with
    variable labels, attributes, and missing data. It is well integrated with basic
    R, 'dplyr'/'tibble', 'data.table', 'sf', 'plm' (panel-series and data frames), and
    accommodates, by virtue of smart internal attribute handling, many other classes
    (like 'ts', 'xts'/'zoo' or 'tsibble').
