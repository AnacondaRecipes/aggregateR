  summary: The SciMark 2.0 benchmark was originally developed in Java as a benchmark for numerical
    and scientific computational performance. It measures the performance of several
    computational kernels which are frequently occurring in scientific applications.
    This package is a simple wrapper around the ANSI C implementation of the benchmark.
