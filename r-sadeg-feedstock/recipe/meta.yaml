  summary: We analyzed the nucleotide composition of genes with a special emphasis on stability
    of DNA sequences. Besides, in a variety of different organisms unequal use of synonymous
    codons, or codon usage bias, occurs which also show variation among genes in the
    same genome. Seemingly, codon usage bias is affected by both selective constraints
    and mutation bias which allows and enables us to examine and detect changes in these
    two evolutionary forces between genomes or along one genome. Therefore, we determined
    the codon adaptation index (CAI), effective number of codons (ENC) and codon usage
    analysis with calculation of the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), and subsequently
    predicted the translation efficiency and accuracy through GC-rich codon usages.
    Furthermore, we estimated the relative stability of the DNA sequence following calculation
    of the average free energy (Delta G) and Dimer base-stacking energy level.
