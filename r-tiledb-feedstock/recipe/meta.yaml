  summary: The universal storage engine 'TileDB' introduces a powerful on-disk format for multi-dimensional
    arrays. It supports dense and sparse arrays, dataframes and key-values stores, cloud
    storage ('S3', 'GCS', 'Azure'), chunked arrays, multiple compression, encryption
    and checksum filters, uses a fully multi-threaded implementation, supports parallel
    I/O, data versioning ('time travel'), metadata and groups. It is implemented as
    an embeddable cross-platform C++ library with APIs from several languages, and integrations.

# SystemRequirements: A C++17 compiler is required, and on macOS compilation for version 11.14 is required. Optionally cmake (only when TileDB source build selected), git (only when TileDB source build selected); on x86_64 and M1 platforms pre-built TileDB Embedded libraries are available at GitHub and are used if no TileDB installation is detected, and no other option to build or download was specified by the user.
