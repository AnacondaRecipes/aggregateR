  summary: Computation of standardized interquartile range (IQR), Huber-type skipped mean (Hampel
    (1985), <doi:10.2307/1268758>), robust coefficient of variation (CV) (Arachchige
    et al. (2019), <arXiv:1907.01110>), robust signal to noise ratio (SNR), z-score,
    standardized mean difference (SMD), as well as functions that support graphical
    visualization such as boxplots based on quartiles (not hinges), negative logarithms
    and generalized logarithms for 'ggplot2' (Wickham (2016), ISBN:978-3-319-24277-4).
