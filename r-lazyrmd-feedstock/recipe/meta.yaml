  summary: An R Markdown html document format that provides the ability to lazily load plot outputs
    as the user scrolls over them.  This is useful for large R Markdown documents with
    many plots, as it allows for a fast initial page load and defers loading of individual
    graphics to the time that the user navigates near them.
