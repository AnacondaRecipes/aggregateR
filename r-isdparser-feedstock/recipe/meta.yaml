  summary: Tools for parsing 'NOAA' Integrated Surface Data ('ISD') files, described at <https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/isd>.
    Data includes for example, wind speed and direction, temperature, cloud data, sea
    level pressure, and more. Includes data from approximately 35,000 stations worldwide,
    though best coverage is in North America/Europe/Australia. Data is stored as variable
    length ASCII character strings, with most fields optional. Included are tools for
    parsing entire files, or individual lines of data.
