  summary: Extract metadata from 'NetCDF' data sources, these can be files, file handles or servers.
    This package leverages and extends the lower level functions of the 'RNetCDF' package
    providing a consistent set of functions that all return data frames. We introduce
    named concepts of 'grid', 'axis' and 'source' which are all meaningful entities
    without formal definition in the 'NetCDF' library <https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/>.
    'RNetCDF' matches the library itself with only the named concepts of 'variables',
    'dimensions' and 'attributes'.
