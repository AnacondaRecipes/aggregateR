  summary: A 'modeltime' extension that implements time series ensemble forecasting methods including
    model averaging, weighted averaging, and stacking. These techniques are popular
    methods to improve forecast accuracy and stability. Refer to papers such as "Machine-Learning
    Models for Sales Time Series Forecasting" Pavlyshenko, B.M. (2019) <doi:10.3390>.
