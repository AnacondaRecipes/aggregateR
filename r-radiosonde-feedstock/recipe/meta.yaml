  summary: 'RadioSonde is a collection of programs for reading and plotting SKEW-T,log p diagrams
    and wind profiles for data collected by radiosondes (the typical weather balloon-borne
    instrument), which we will call "flights", "sondes", or "profiles" throughout the
    associated documentation.  The raw data files are in a common format that has a
    header followed by specific variables.  Use "help(ExampleSonde)" for the full explanation
    of the data files. '
