  summary: Offers a variety of tools, such as specific plots and regression model approaches,
    for analyzing different patient reported questionnaires. Specially, mixed-effects
    models based on the beta-binomial distribution are implemented to deal with binomial
    data with over-dispersion  (see Najera-Zuloaga J., Lee D.-J. and Arostegui I. (2018)
    <doi:10.1177/0962280217690413>).
