  summary: A comprehensive tool for almost all existing multiple testing methods for discrete
    data. The package also provides some novel multiple testing procedures controlling
    FWER/FDR for discrete data. Given discrete p-values and their domains, the [method].p.adjust
    function returns adjusted p-values, which can be used to compare with the nominal
    significant level alpha and make decisions. For users' convenience, the functions
    also provide the output option  for printing decision rules.
