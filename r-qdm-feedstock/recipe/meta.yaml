  summary: This package provides different specifications of a Quadrilateral Dissimilarity Model
    which can be used to fit same-different judgments in order to get a predicted matrix
    that satisfies regular minimality [Colonius & Dzhafarov, 2006, Measurement and representations
    of sensations, Erlbaum]. From such a matrix, Fechnerian distances can be computed.
