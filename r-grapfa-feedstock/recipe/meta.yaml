  summary: 'gRapfa is for modelling discrete longitudinal data using acyclic probabilistic finite
    automata (APFA). The package contains functions for constructing APFA models from
    a given data using penalized likelihood methods. For graphical display of APFA models,
    gRapfa depends on ''igraph package''. gRapfa also contains an interface function
    to Beagle software that implements an efficient model selection algorithm. '
