  summary: A toolkit with infrastructure for representing, summarizing, and visualizing tree-structured
    regression and classification models. This unified infrastructure can be used for
    reading/coercing tree models from different sources ('rpart', 'RWeka', 'PMML') yielding
    objects that share functionality for print()/plot()/predict() methods. Furthermore,
    new and improved reimplementations of conditional inference trees (ctree()) and
    model-based recursive partitioning (mob()) from the 'party' package are provided
    based on the new infrastructure. A description of this package was published by
    Hothorn and Zeileis (2015) <https://jmlr.org/papers/v16/hothorn15a.html>.
