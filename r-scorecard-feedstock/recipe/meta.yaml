  summary: 'The `scorecard` package makes the development of credit risk scorecard easier and
    efficient by providing functions for some common tasks, such as data partition,
    variable selection, woe binning, scorecard scaling, performance evaluation and report
    generation. These functions can also used in the development of machine learning
    models. The references including: 1. Refaat, M. (2011, ISBN: 9781447511199). Credit
