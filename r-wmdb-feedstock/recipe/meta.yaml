  summary: Distance discriminant analysis method is one of classification methods according to
    multiindex performance parameters.However,the traditional Mahalanobis distance discriminant
    method treats with the importance of all parameters equally,and exaggerates the
    role of parameters which changes a little.The weighted Mahalanobis distance is used
    in discriminant analysis method to distinguish the importance of each parameter.In
    the concrete application,firstly based on the principal component analysis scheme,a
    new group of parameters and their corresponding percent contributions of the parameters
    are calculated ,and the weighted matrix is regarded as the diagonal matrix of the
    contributions rates.Setting data to standardization,then the weighted Mahalanobis
    distance can be calculated.Besides the methods metioned above,bayes method is also
    given.
