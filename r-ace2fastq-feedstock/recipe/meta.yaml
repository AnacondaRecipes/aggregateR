  summary: The ACE file format is used in genomics to store contigs from sequencing machines.
    This tools converts it into FASTQ format. Both formats contain the  sequence characters
    and their corresponding quality information. Unlike the FASTQ file, the ace file
    stores the quality values numerically. The conversion algorithm uses the standard
    Sanger formula. The package facilitates insertion into pipelines, and content inspection.
