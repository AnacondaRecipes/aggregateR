  summary: Calculates graph theoretic scagnostics. Scagnostics describe various measures of interest
    for pairs of variables, based on their appearance on a scatterplot.  They are useful
    tool for discovering interesting or unusual scatterplots from a scatterplot matrix,
    without having to look at every individual plot.
