  summary: Implementation of uniformly most powerful invariant equivalence tests for one- and
    two-sample problems (paired and unpaired) as described in Wellek (2010, ISBN:978-1-4398-0818-4).
    Also one-sided alternatives (non-inferiority and non-superiority tests) are supported.
    Basically a variant of a t-test with (relaxed) null and alternative hypotheses exchanged.
