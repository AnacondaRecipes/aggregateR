  summary: Provides R bindings for Google's s2 library for geometric calculations on the sphere.
    High-performance constructors and exporters provide high compatibility with existing
    spatial packages, transformers construct new geometries from existing geometries,
    predicates provide a means to select geometries based on spatial relationships,
    and accessors extract information about geometries.
