  summary: 'Provide multinomial design methods under intersection-union test (IUT) and union-intersection
    test (UIT) scheme for Phase II trial. The design types include : Minimax (minimize
    the maximum sample size), Optimal (minimize the expected sample size), Admissible
    (minimize the Bayesian risk) and Maxpower (maximize the exact power level).'
