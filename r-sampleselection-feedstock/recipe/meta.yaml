  summary: 'Two-step and maximum likelihood estimation of Heckman-type sample selection models:
    standard sample selection models (Tobit-2), endogenous switching regression models
    (Tobit-5), sample selection models with binary dependent outcome variable, interval
    regression with sample selection (only ML estimation), and endogenous treatment
    effects models. These methods are described in the three vignettes that are included
    in this package and in econometric textbooks such as Greene (2011, Econometric Analysis,
    7th edition, Pearson).'
