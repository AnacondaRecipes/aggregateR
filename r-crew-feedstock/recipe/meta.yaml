  summary: In computationally demanding analysis projects, statisticians and data scientists
    asynchronously deploy long-running tasks to distributed systems, ranging from traditional
    clusters to cloud services. The 'NNG'-powered 'mirai' R package by Gao (2023) <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mirai>
    is a sleek and sophisticated scheduler that efficiently processes these intense
    workloads. The 'crew' package extends 'mirai' with a unifying interface for third-party
    worker launchers. Inspiration also comes from packages. 'future' by Bengtsson (2021)
