  summary: Using the Theory of Belief Functions for evidence calculus. Basic probability assignments,
    or mass functions, can be defined on the subsets of a set of possible values and
    combined. A mass function can be extended to a larger frame. Marginalization, i.e.
    reduction to a smaller frame can also be done. These features can be combined to
    analyze small belief networks and take into account situations where information
    cannot be satisfactorily described by probability distributions.
