  summary: A utility library to facilitate the generalization of statistical methods built on
    a regression framework. Package developers can use 'modelObj' methods to initiate
    a regression analysis without concern for the details of the regression model and
    the method to be used to obtain parameter estimates. The specifics of the regression
    step are left to the user to define when calling the function. The user of a function
    developed within the 'modelObj' framework creates as input a 'modelObj' that contains
    the model and the R methods to be used to obtain parameter estimates and to obtain
    predictions.  In this way, a user can easily go from linear to non-linear models
    within the same package.
