  summary: Hedgehog will eat all your bugs. 'Hedgehog' is a property-based testing package in
    the spirit of 'QuickCheck'. With 'Hedgehog', one can test properties of their programs
    against randomly generated input, providing far superior test coverage compared
    to unit testing. One of the key benefits of 'Hedgehog' is integrated shrinking of
    counterexamples, which allows one to quickly find the cause of bugs, given salient
    examples when incorrect behaviour occurs.
