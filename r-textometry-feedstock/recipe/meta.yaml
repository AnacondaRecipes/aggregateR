  summary: Statistical exploration of textual corpora using several methods from French 'Textometrie'
    (new name of 'Lexicometrie') and French 'Data Analysis' schools. It includes methods
    for exploring irregularity of distribution of lexicon features across text sets
    or parts of texts (Specificity analysis); multi-dimensional exploration (Factorial
    analysis), etc. Those methods are used in the TXM software.
