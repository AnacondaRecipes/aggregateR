  summary: FDR functions for permutation-based estimators, including pi0 as well as FDR confidence
    intervals. The confidence intervals account for dependencies between tests by the
    incorporation of an overdispersion parameter, which is estimated from the permuted
    data. Also included are options for an analog parametric approach.
