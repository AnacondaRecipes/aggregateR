  summary: 'Included are two main interfaces for fitting and diagnosing bent-cable regressions
    for autoregressive time-series data or independent data (time series or otherwise):
    ''bentcable.ar()'' and ''bentcable.dev.plot()''. Some components in the package
    can also be used as stand-alone functions. The bent cable (linear-quadratic-linear)
    generalizes the broken stick (linear-linear), which is also handled by this package.
    Version 0.2 corrects a glitch in the computation of confidence intervals for the
    CTP. References that were updated from Versions 0.2.1 and 0.2.2 appear in Version
    0.2.3 and up. Version 0.3.0 improves robustness of the error-message producing mechanism.
    It is the author''s intention to distribute any future updates via GitHub.'
