  summary: Utilities for the Pareto, piecewise Pareto and generalized Pareto distribution that
    are useful for reinsurance pricing. In particular, the package provides a non-trivial
    algorithm that can be used to match the expected losses of a tower of reinsurance
    layers with a layer-independent collective risk model. The theoretical background
    of the matching algorithm and most other methods are described in Ulrich Riegel
    (2018) <doi:10.1007/s13385-018-0177-3>.
