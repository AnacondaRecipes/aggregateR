  summary: Converts graphical file formats (SVG, PNG, JPEG, BMP, GIF, PDF, etc) to one another.
    The exceptions are the SVG file format that can only be converted to other formats
    and in contrast, PDF format, which can only be created from others graphical formats.
    The main purpose of the package was to provide a solution for converting SVG file
    format to PNG which is often needed for exporting graphical files produced by R
    widgets.
