  summary: An implementation of the Log Cumulative Probability Model (LCPM)  and Proportional
    Probability Model (PPM) for which the Maximum Likelihood Estimates are determined
    using constrained optimization.  This implementation accounts for the implicit constraints
    on the parameter space. Other  features such as standard errors, z tests and p-values
    use standard methods adapted from the results based on constrained optimization.
