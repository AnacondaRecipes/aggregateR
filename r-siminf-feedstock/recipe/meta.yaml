  summary: Provides an efficient and very flexible framework to conduct data-driven epidemiological
    modeling in realistic large scale disease spread simulations. The framework integrates
    infection dynamics in subpopulations as continuous-time Markov chains using the
    Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm and incorporates available data such as
    births, deaths and movements as scheduled events at predefined time-points. Using
    C code for the numerical solvers and 'OpenMP' (if available) to divide work over
    multiple processors ensures high performance when simulating a sample outcome. One
    of our design goals was to make the package extendable and enable usage of the numerical
    solvers from other R extension packages in order to facilitate complex epidemiological
    research. The package contains template models and can be extended with user-defined
    models.
