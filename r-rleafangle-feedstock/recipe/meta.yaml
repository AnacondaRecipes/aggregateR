  summary: 'Leaf angle distribution is described by a number of functions (e.g. ellipsoidal,
    Beta and rotated ellipsoidal). The parameters of leaf angle distributions functions
    are estimated through different empirical relationship. This package includes estimations
    of parameters of different leaf angle distribution function, plots and evaluates
    leaf angle distribution functions, calculates extinction coefficients given leaf
    angle distribution. Reference: Wang(2007)<doi:10.1016/j.agrformet.2006.12.003>.'
