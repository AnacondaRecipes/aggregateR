  summary: An R implementation of an extension of the 'BayeScan' software (Foll, 2008) <DOI:10.1534/genetics.108.092221>
    for codominant markers, adding the option to group individual SNPs into pre-defined
    blocks. A typical application of this new approach is the identification of genomic
    regions, genes, or gene sets containing one or more SNPs that evolved under directional
    selection.
