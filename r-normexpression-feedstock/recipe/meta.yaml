  summary: It provides a framework and a fast and simple way for researchers to evaluate methods
    (particularly some data-driven methods or their own methods) and then select a best
    one for data normalization in the gene expression analysis, based on the consistency
    of metrics and the consistency of datasets. Zhenfeng Wu, Weixiang Liu, Xiufeng Jin,
