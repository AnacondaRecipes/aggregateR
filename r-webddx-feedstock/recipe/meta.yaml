  summary: Freely available online differential-diagnosis generating tools are changing clinical
    medicine and biomedical research. With webddx, useRs can generate differential diagnosis
    lists given a set of symptoms. The web tools would likely be directly used in clinical
    practice, but programmatic interaction and data manipulation can sharply increase
    efficiency and reproducibility of research in clinical informatics. Relevant visualizations
    can also be created with webddx.
