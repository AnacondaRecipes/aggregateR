  summary: 'Vector operations between grapes: An infix-only package! The ''invctr'' functions
    perform common and less common operations on vectors, data frames matrices and list
    objects: - Extracting a value (range), or, finding the indices of a value (range).
    - Trimming, or padding a vector with a value of your choice. - Simple polynomial
    regression. - Set and membership operations. - General check & replace function
    for NAs, Inf and other values.'
