  summary: The algorithm Leabra (local error driven and associative biologically realistic algorithm)
    allows for the construction of artificial neural networks that are biologically
    realistic and balance supervised and unsupervised learning within a single framework.
    This package is based on the 'MATLAB' version by Sergio Verduzco-Flores, which in
    turn was based on the description of the algorithm by Randall O'Reilly (1996) <ftp://grey.colorado.edu/pub/oreilly/thesis/oreilly_thesis.all.pdf>.
    For more general (not 'R' specific) information on the algorithm Leabra see <https://grey.colorado.edu/emergent/index.php/Leabra>.
