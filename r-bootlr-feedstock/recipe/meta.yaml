  summary: Computes appropriate confidence intervals for the likelihood ratio tests commonly
    used in medicine/epidemiology, using the method of Marill et al. (2015) <doi:10.1177/0962280215592907>.  It
    is particularly useful when the sensitivity or specificity in the sample is 100%.  Note
    that this does not perform the test on nested models--for that, see 'epicalc::lrtest'.
