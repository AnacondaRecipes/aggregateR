  summary: 'There are 6 novel robust tests for equal correlation. They are all based on logistic
    regressions. U are proportion to different types of correlation in  6 methods. The
    ST1() is based on Pearson correlation. ST2() improved ST1() by using median absolute
    deviation. ST3() utilized type M correlation and ST4() used Spearman correlation.
    ST5() and ST6() used two different ways to combine ST3() and ST4().  We highly recommend
    ST5() according to the passage New Statistical Methods for Constructing Robust Differential
    Correlation Networks to characterize the interactions among microRNAs published
    in Scientific Reports. '
