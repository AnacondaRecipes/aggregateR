  summary: An extension of 'knitr' that adds flexibility in several ways. One common source of
    frustration with 'knitr' is that it assumes the directory where the source file
    lives should be the working directory, which is often not true. 'ezknitr' addresses
    this problem by giving you complete control over where all the inputs and outputs
    are, and adds several other convenient features to make rendering markdown/HTML
    documents easier.
