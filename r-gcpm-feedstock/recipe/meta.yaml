  summary: Analyze the default risk of credit portfolios. Commonly known models, like CreditRisk+
    or the CreditMetrics model are implemented in their very basic settings. The portfolio
    loss distribution can be achieved either by simulation or analytically in case of
    the classic CreditRisk+ model. Models are only implemented to respect losses caused
    by defaults, i.e. migration risk is not included. The package structure is kept
    flexible especially with respect to distributional assumptions in order to quantify
    the sensitivity of risk figures with respect to several assumptions. Therefore the
    package can be used to determine the credit risk of a given portfolio as well as
    to quantify model sensitivities.
