  summary: Use the perturb() function to evaluates collinearity by adding  random noise to selected
    variables (Hendrickx & Pelzer 2004). The colldiag  function() calculates condition
    numbers and variance decomposition proportions  to test for collinearity and uncover
    its sources (Belsley 1980).
