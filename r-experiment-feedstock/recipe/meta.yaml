  summary: Provides various statistical methods for designing and analyzing randomized experiments.
    One functionality of the package is the implementation of randomized-block and matched-pair
    designs based on possibly multivariate pre-treatment covariates. The package also
    provides the tools to analyze various randomized experiments including cluster randomized
    experiments, two-stage randomized experiments, randomized experiments with  noncompliance,
    and randomized experiments with missing data.
