  summary: Implementation of the sparse autoencoder in R environment, following the notes of
    Andrew Ng (http://www.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs294a/cs294a.1104/sparseAutoencoder.pdf).
    The features learned by the hidden layer of the autoencoder (through unsupervised
    learning of unlabeled data) can be used in constructing deep belief neural networks.
