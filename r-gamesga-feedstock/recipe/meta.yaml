  summary: Finds adaptive strategies for sequential symmetric games using a genetic algorithm.
    Currently, any symmetric two by two matrix is allowed, and strategies can remember
    the history of an opponent's play from the previous three rounds of moves in iterated
    interactions between players. The genetic algorithm returns a list of adaptive strategies
    given payoffs, and the mean fitness of strategies in each generation.
