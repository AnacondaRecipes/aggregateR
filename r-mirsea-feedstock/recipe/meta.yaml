  summary: The tools for 'MicroRNA Set Enrichment Analysis' can identify risk pathways(or prior
    gene sets) regulated by microRNA set in the context of microRNA expression data.
    (1) This package constructs a correlation profile of microRNA and pathways by the
    hypergeometric statistic test. The gene sets of pathways derived from the three
    public databases (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ('KEGG'); 'Reactome';
    'Biocarta') and the target gene sets of microRNA are provided by four databases('TarBaseV6.0';
    'mir2Disease'; 'miRecords'; 'miRTarBase';). (2) This package can quantify the change
    of correlation between microRNA for each pathway(or prior gene set) based on a microRNA
    expression data with cases and controls. (3) This package uses the weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov
    statistic to calculate an enrichment score (ES) of a microRNA set that co-regulate
    to a pathway , which reflects the degree to which a given pathway is associated
    with the specific phenotype. (4) This package can provide the visualization of the
    results.
