  summary: Computes nonparametric probability distributions (probability density functions, cumulative
    distribution functions and quantile functions) using kernel smoothing. Supports
    univariate, multivariate and conditional distributions, and weighted data (possibly
    useful mixed with fuzzy clustering or frequency data). Also, supports empirical
    continuous cumulative distribution functions and their inverses, and random number
    generation.
