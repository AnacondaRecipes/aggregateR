  summary: Hybrid Mortality Modelling (HMM) provides a framework in which mortality around "the
    accident hump" and at very old ages can be modelled under a single model. The graphics'
    codes necessary for visualization of the models' output are included here. Specifically,
    the graphics are based on the assumption that, the mortality rates can be expressed
    as a function of the area under the curve between the crude mortality rates plots
    and the tangential transform of the force of mortality.
