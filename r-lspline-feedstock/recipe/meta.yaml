  summary: Linear splines with convenient parametrisations such that  (1) coefficients are slopes
    of consecutive segments or (2) coefficients are  slope changes at consecutive knots.
    Knots can be set manually or at break points of equal-frequency or equal-width intervals
    covering the range of 'x'. The implementation follows Greene (2003), chapter 7.2.5.
