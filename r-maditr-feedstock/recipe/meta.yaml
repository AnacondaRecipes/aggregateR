  summary: Package provides pipe-style interface for 'data.table'. It preserves all 'data.table'
    features without significant impact on performance. 'let' and 'take' functions are
    simplified interfaces for most common data manipulation tasks. For example, you
    can write 'mtcars %>% take(mean(mpg), by = am)' for  aggregation or 'mtcars %>%
    let(hp_wt = hp/wt, hp_wt_mpg = hp_wt/mpg)' for modification. Use 'take_if/let_if'
    for conditional aggregation/modification. 'query_if' function translates its arguments
    one-to-one to '[.data.table' method. Additionally there are some conveniences such
    as automatic 'data.frame' conversion to 'data.table'.
