  summary: 'This package implements a method for normalization, testing, and false discovery
    rate estimation for RNA-sequencing data. The description of the method is in Li
    J, Witten DM, Johnstone I, Tibshirani R (2012). Normalization, testing, and false
    discovery rate estimation for RNA-sequencing data. Biostatistics 13(3): 523-38.
    We estimate the sequencing depths of experiments using a new method based on Poisson
    goodness-of-fit statistic, calculate a score statistic on the basis of a Poisson
    log-linear model, and then estimate the false discovery rate using a modified version
    of permutation plug-in method. A more detailed instruction as well as sample data
    is available at http://www.stanford.edu/~junli07/research.html.  In this version,
    we changed the way of calculating log foldchange for two-class data. The FDR estimation
    part remains unchanged.'
