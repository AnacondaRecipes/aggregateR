  summary: 'Solves convex cone programs via operator splitting. Can solve: linear programs (''LPs''),
    second-order cone programs (''SOCPs''), semidefinite programs (''SDPs''), exponential
    cone programs (''ECPs''), and power cone programs (''PCPs''), or problems with any
    combination of those cones. ''SCS'' uses ''AMD'' (a set of routines for permuting
    sparse matrices prior to factorization) and ''LDL'' (a sparse ''LDL'' factorization
    and solve package) from ''SuiteSparse'' (<https://people.engr.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html>).'
