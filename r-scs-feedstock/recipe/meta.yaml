  summary: 'Solves convex cone programs via operator splitting. Can solve: linear programs (LPs),
    second-order cone programs (SOCPs), semidefinite programs (SDPs), exponential cone
    programs (ECPs), and power cone programs (PCPs), or problems with any combination
    of those cones. SCS uses AMD (a set of routines for permuting sparse matrices prior
    to factorization) and LDL (a sparse LDL'' factorization and solve package) from
    ''SuiteSparse'' (<http://www.suitesparse.com>).'
