  summary: Documentation and prototypes for the earliest (circa 2010) open-source effort to reverse
    engineer the sas7bdat file format. The package includes a prototype reader for sas7bdat
    files. However, newer packages (notably the haven package) contain more robust readers
    for sas7bdat files.
