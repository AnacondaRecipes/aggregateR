  summary: Provides data sets for teaching statistics and data science courses. It includes a
    sample of data from John Edmund Kerrich's famous coinflip experiment. These are
    data that I used for teaching SOC 4015 / SOC 5050 at Saint Louis University (SLU).
    The package also contains an R Markdown template with the required formatting for
    assignments in my courses SOC 4015, SOC 4650, SOC 5050, and SOC 5650 at SLU.
