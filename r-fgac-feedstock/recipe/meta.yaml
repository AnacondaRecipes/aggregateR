  summary: 'Bi-variate data fitting is done by two stochastic components: the marginal distributions
    and the dependency structure. The dependency structure is modeled through a copula.
    An algorithm was implemented considering seven families of copulas (Generalized
    Archimedean Copulas), the best fitting can be obtained looking all copula''s options
    (totally positive of order 2 and stochastically increasing models).'
