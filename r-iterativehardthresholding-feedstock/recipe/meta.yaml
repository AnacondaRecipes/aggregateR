  summary: Fits large-scale regression models with a penalty that restricts the maximum number
    of non-zero regression coefficients to a prespecified value.  While Chu et al (2020)
    <doi:10.1093/gigascience/giaa044> describe the basic algorithm, this package uses
    Cyclops for an efficient implementation.
