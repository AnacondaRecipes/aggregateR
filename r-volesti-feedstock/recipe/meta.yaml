  summary: Provides an R interface for 'volesti' C++ package. 'volesti' computes estimations
    of volume of polytopes given by (i) a set of points, (ii) linear inequalities or
    (iii) Minkowski sum of segments (a.k.a. zonotopes). There are three algorithms for
    volume estimation as well as algorithms for sampling, rounding and rotating polytopes.
    Moreover, 'volesti' provides algorithms for estimating copulas useful in computational
    finance. Methods implemented in 'volesti' are described in A. Chalkis and V. Fisikopoulos
    (2022) <doi:10.32614/RJ-2021-077> and references therein.
