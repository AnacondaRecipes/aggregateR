  summary: Univariate feature selection and compound covariate methods under the Cox model with
    high-dimensional features (e.g., gene expressions). Available are survival data
    for non-small-cell lung cancer patients with gene expressions (Chen et al 2007 New
    Engl J Med) <DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa060096>, statistical methods in Emura et al (2012

    Algorithms for generating correlated gene expressions are also available.
