  summary: SetRNG provides utilities to help set and record the setting of the seed and the uniform
    and normal generators used when a random experiment is run. The utilities can be
    used in other functions  that do random experiments to simplify recording and/or
    setting all the  necessary information for reproducibility.  See the vignette and
    reference manual for examples.
