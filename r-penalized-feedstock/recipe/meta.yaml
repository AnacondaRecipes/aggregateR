  summary: Fitting possibly high dimensional penalized regression models. The penalty structure
    can be any combination of an L1 penalty (lasso and fused lasso), an L2 penalty (ridge)
    and a positivity constraint on the regression coefficients. The supported regression
    models are linear, logistic and Poisson regression and the Cox Proportional Hazards
    model. Cross-validation routines allow optimization of the tuning parameters.
