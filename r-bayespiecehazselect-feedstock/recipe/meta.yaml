  summary: Fits a piecewise exponential hazard to survival data using a Hierarchical Bayesian
    model with an Intrinsic Conditional Autoregressive formulation for the spatial dependency
    in the hazard rates for each piece. This function uses Metropolis- Hastings-Green
    MCMC to allow the number of split points to vary and also uses Stochastic Search
    Variable Selection to determine what covariates drive the risk of the event. This
    function outputs trace plots depicting the number of split points in the hazard
    and the number of variables included in the hazard. The function saves all posterior
    quantities to the desired path.
