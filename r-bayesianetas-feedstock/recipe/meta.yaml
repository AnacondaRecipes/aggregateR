  summary: The Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence  (ETAS) model is one of the best-performing
    methods for modeling and forecasting earthquake occurrences. This package implements
    Bayesian estimation routines to draw samples from the full posterior distribution
    of the model parameters, given an earthquake catalog. The paper on which this package
    is based is Gordon J. Ross - Bayesian Estimation of the ETAS Model for Earthquake
    Occurrences (2016), available from the below URL.
