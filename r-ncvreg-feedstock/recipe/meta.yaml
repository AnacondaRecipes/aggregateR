  summary: Fits regularization paths for linear regression, GLM, and Cox regression models using
    lasso or nonconvex penalties, in particular the minimax concave penalty (MCP) and
    smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty, with options for additional
    L2 penalties (the "elastic net" idea). Utilities for carrying out cross-validation
    as well as post-fitting visualization, summarization, inference, and prediction
    are also provided. For more information, see Breheny and Huang (2011) <doi:10.1214/10-AOAS388>
