  summary: Fits a generalized linear density ratio model (GLDRM). A GLDRM is a semiparametric
    generalized linear model. In contrast to a GLM, which assumes a particular exponential
    family distribution, the GLDRM uses a semiparametric likelihood to estimate the
    reference distribution. The reference distribution may be any discrete, continuous,
    or mixed exponential family distribution. The model parameters, which include both
    the regression coefficients and the cdf of the unspecified reference distribution,
    are estimated by maximizing a semiparametric likelihood. Regression coefficients
    are estimated with no loss of efficiency, i.e. the asymptotic variance is the same
    as if the true exponential family distribution were known. Huang (2014) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2013.824892>.
