  summary: Solving the linear SVM problem with coordinate descent is very efficient and is implemented
    in one of the most often used packages, 'LIBLINEAR' (available at http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear).
    It has been shown that the uniform selection of coordinates can be accelerated by
    using an online adaptation of coordinate frequencies (ACF). This package implements
    ACF and is based on 'LIBLINEAR' as well as the 'LiblineaR' package (<https://cran.r-project.org/package=LiblineaR>).
    It currently supports L2-regularized L1-loss as well as L2-loss linear SVM. Similar
    to 'LIBLINEAR' multi-class classification (one-vs-the rest, and Crammer & Singer
    method) and cross validation for model selection is supported. The training of the
    models based on ACF is much faster than standard 'LIBLINEAR' on many problems.
