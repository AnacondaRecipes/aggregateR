  summary: From output files obtained from the software 'ModestR', the relative contribution
    of factors to explain species distribution is depicted using several plots. A global
    geographic raster file for each environmental variable may be also obtained with
    the mean relative contribution, considering all species present in each raster cell,
    of the factor to explain species distribution. Finally, for each variable it is
    also possible to compare the frequencies of any variable obtained in the cells where
    the species is present with the frequencies of the same variable in the cells of
    the extent.
