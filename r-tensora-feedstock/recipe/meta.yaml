  summary: Provides convenience functions for advanced linear algebra with tensors and computation
    with datasets of tensors on a higher level abstraction. It includes Einstein and
    Riemann summing conventions, dragging, co- and contravariate indices, parallel computations
    on sequences of tensors.
