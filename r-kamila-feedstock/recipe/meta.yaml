  summary: Implements methods for clustering mixed-type data, specifically combinations of continuous
    and nominal data. Special attention is paid to the often-overlooked problem of equitably
    balancing the contribution of the continuous and categorical variables. This package
    implements KAMILA clustering, a novel method for clustering mixed-type data in the
    spirit of k-means clustering. It does not require dummy coding of variables, and
    is efficient enough to scale to rather large data sets. Also implemented is Modha-Spangler
    clustering, which uses a brute-force strategy to maximize the cluster separation
    simultaneously in the continuous and categorical variables. For more information,
    see Foss, Markatou, Ray, & Heching (2016) <doi:10.1007/s10994-016-5575-7> and Foss
