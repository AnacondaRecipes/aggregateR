  summary: An algorithm which can be used to determine an objective threshold for signal-noise
    separation in large random matrices (correlation matrices, mutual information matrices,
    network adjacency matrices) is provided. The package makes use of the results of
    Random Matrix Theory (RMT). The algorithm increments a suppositional threshold monotonically,
    thereby recording the eigenvalue spacing distribution of the matrix. According to
    RMT, that distribution undergoes a characteristic change when the threshold properly
    separates signal from noise. By using the algorithm, the modular structure of a
    matrix - or of the corresponding network - can be unraveled.
