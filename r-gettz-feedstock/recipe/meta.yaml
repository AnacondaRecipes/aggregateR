  summary: A function to retrieve the system timezone on Unix systems which has been found to
    find an answer when 'Sys.timezone()' has failed. It is based on an answer by Duane
    McCully posted on 'StackOverflow', and adapted to be callable from R. The package
    also builds on Windows, but just returns NULL.
