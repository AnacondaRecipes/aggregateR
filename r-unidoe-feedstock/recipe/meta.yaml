  summary: Efficient procedures for constructing uniform design of experiments under various
    space-filling criteria. It is based on a stochastic and adaptive threshold accepting
    algorithm with flexible initialization, adaptive threshold, and stochastic evolution.
    The package may also construct the augmented uniform designs in a sequential manner.
