  summary: Provides functions to compute various germination indices such as germinability, median
    germination time, mean germination time, mean germination rate, speed of germination,
    Timson's index, germination value, coefficient of uniformity of germination, uncertainty
    of germination process, synchrony of germination etc. from germination count data.
    Includes functions for fitting cumulative seed germination curves using four-parameter
    hill function and computation of associated parameters. See the vignette for more,
    including full list of citations for the methods implemented.
