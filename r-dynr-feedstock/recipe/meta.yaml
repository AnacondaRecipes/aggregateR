  summary: Intensive longitudinal data have become increasingly prevalent in various scientific
    disciplines. Many such data sets are noisy, multivariate, and multi-subject in nature.
    The change functions may also be continuous, or continuous but interspersed with
    periods of discontinuities (i.e., showing regime switches). The package 'dynr' (Dynamic
    Modeling in R) is an R package that implements a set of computationally efficient
    algorithms for handling a broad class of linear and nonlinear discrete- and continuous-
    time models with regime-switching properties under the constraint of linear Gaussian
    measurement functions. The discrete-time models can generally take on the form of
    a state-space or difference equation model. The continuous-time models are generally
    expressed as a set of ordinary or stochastic differential equations. All estimation
    and computations are performed in C, but users are provided with the option to specify
    the model of interest via a set of simple and easy-to-learn model specification
    functions in R. Model fitting can be performed using single-subject time series
    data or multiple-subject longitudinal data. Ou, Hunter, & Chow (2019) <doi:10.32614%2FRJ-2019-012>
    provided a detailed introduction to the interface and more information on the algorithms.
