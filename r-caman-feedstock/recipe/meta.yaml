  summary: Tools for the analysis of finite semiparametric mixtures. These are useful when data
    is heterogeneous, e.g. in pharmacokinetics or meta-analysis. The NPMLE and VEM algorithms
    (flexible support size) and EM algorithms (fixed support size) are provided for
    univariate and bivariate data.
