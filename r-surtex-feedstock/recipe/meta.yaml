  summary: suRtex was designed for easy descriptive statistic reporting of categorical survey
    data (e.g., Likert scales) in LaTeX. suRtex takes a matrix or data frame and produces
    the LaTeX code necessary for a sideways table creation. Mean, median, standard deviation,
    and sample size are optional.
