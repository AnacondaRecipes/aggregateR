  summary: Estimates the Concordance Correlation Coefficient to assess agreement. The scenarios
    considered are non-repeated measures, non-longitudinal repeated measures (replicates)
    and longitudinal repeated measures. The estimation approaches implemented are variance
    components and U-statistics approaches.
