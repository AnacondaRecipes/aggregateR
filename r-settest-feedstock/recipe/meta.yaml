  summary: It provides cumulative distribution function (CDF), quantile, p-value, statistical
    power calculator and random number generator for a collection of group-testing procedures,
    including the Higher Criticism tests, the one-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, the
    one-sided Berk-Jones tests, the one-sided phi-divergence tests, etc. The input are
    a group of p-values. The null hypothesis is that they are i.i.d. Uniform(0,1). In
    the context of signal detection, the null hypothesis means no signals. In the context
    of the goodness-of-fit testing, which contrasts a group of i.i.d. random variables
    to a given continuous distribution, the input p-values can be obtained by the CDF
    transformation. The null hypothesis means that these random variables follow the
    given distribution. For reference, see Hong Zhang, Jiashun Jin and Zheyang Wu. "Distributions
    and Statistical Power of Optimal Signal-Detection Methods In Finite Cases", submitted.
