  summary: Implementation of the algorithm introduced in Shah, R. D. (2016) <http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume17/13-515/13-515.pdf>.
    Data with thousands of predictors can be handled. The algorithm performs sequential
    Lasso fits on design matrices containing increasing sets of candidate interactions.
    Previous fits are used to greatly speed up subsequent fits so the algorithm is very
    efficient.
