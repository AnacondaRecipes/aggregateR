  summary: Functions to select samples using PPS (probability proportional to size) sampling.
    The package also includes a function for stratified simple random sampling, a function
    to compute joint inclusion probabilities for Sampford's method of PPS sampling,
    and a few utility functions. The user's guide pps-ug.pdf is included in the .../pps/doc
    directory. The methods are described in standard survey sampling theory books such
    as Cochran's "Sampling Techniques"; see the user's guide for references.
