  summary: The pps package contains functions to select samples using PPS (probability proportional
    to size) sampling. It also includes a function for stratified simple random sampling,
    a function to compute joint inclusion probabilities for Sampford's method of PPS
    sampling, and a few utility functions. The user's guide pps-ug.pdf is included.
