  summary: Functions for age-period-cohort analysis. The data can be organised in matrices indexed
    by age-cohort, age-period or cohort-period. The data can include dose and response
    or just doses. The statistical model is a generalized linear model (GLM) allowing
    for 3,2,1 or 0 of the age-period-cohort factors. The canonical parametrisation of
    Kuang, Nielsen and Nielsen (2008) <DOI:10.1093/biomet/asn026> is used. Thus, the
    analysis does not rely on ad hoc identification.
