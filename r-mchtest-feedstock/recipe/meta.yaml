  summary: Performs Monte Carlo hypothesis tests, allowing a couple of different sequential stopping
    boundaries. For example, a truncated sequential probability ratio test boundary
    (Fay, Kim and Hachey, 2007 <DOI:10.1198/106186007X257025>) and a boundary proposed
    by Besag and Clifford, 1991 <DOI:10.1093/biomet/78.2.301>. Gives valid p-values
    and confidence intervals on p-values.
