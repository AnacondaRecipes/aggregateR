  summary: Functions to safely map from a vector of keys to a vector of values, determine properties
    of a given relation, or ensure a relation conforms to a given type, such as many-to-many,
    one-to-many, injective, surjective, or bijective. Permits default return values
    for use similar to a vectorised switch statement, as well as safely handling large
    vectors, NAs, and duplicate mappings.
