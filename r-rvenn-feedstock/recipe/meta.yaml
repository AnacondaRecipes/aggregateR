  summary: Set operations for many sets. The base functions for set operations in R can be used
    for only two sets. This package uses 'purr' to find the union, intersection and
    difference of three or more sets. This package also provides functions for pairwise
    set operations among several sets. Further, based on 'ggplot2' and 'ggforce', a
    Venn diagram can be drawn for two or three sets. For bigger data sets, a clustered
    heatmap showing presence/absence of the elements of the sets can be drawn based
    on the 'pheatmap' package. Finally, enrichment test can be applied to two sets whether
    an overlap is statistically significant or not.
