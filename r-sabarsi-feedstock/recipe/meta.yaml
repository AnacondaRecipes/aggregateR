  summary: 'Implements a new approach ''SABARSI'' described in Wang et al., "A Statistical Approach
    of Background Removal and Spectrum Identification for SERS Data" (Unpublished).  Sabarsi
    forms a pipeline for SERS (surface-enhanced Raman scattering) data analysis including
    background removal, signal detection, signal integration, and cross-experiment comparison.
    The background removal algorithm, the very first step of SERS data analysis, takes
    into account the change of background shape.   '
