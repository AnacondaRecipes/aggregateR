  summary: Calculations of an information criterion are proposed to check the quality of simulations
    results of Agent-based models (ABM/IBM) or other non-linear rule-based models. The
    POMDEV measure (Pattern Oriented Modelling DEViance) is based on the Kullback-Leibler
    divergence and likelihood theory. It basically indicates the deviance of simulation
    results from field observations. Once POMDEV scores and metropolis-hasting sampling
    on different model versions are effectuated, POMIC scores (Pattern Oriented Modelling
    Information Criterion) can be calculated. This method could be further developed
    to incorporate multiple patterns assessment. Piou C, U Berger and V Grimm (2009)
