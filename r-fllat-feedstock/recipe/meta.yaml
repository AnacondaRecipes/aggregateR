  summary: Fits the Fused Lasso Latent Feature model, which is used for modeling multi-sample
    aCGH data to identify regions of copy number variation (CNV).  Produces a set of
    features that describe the patterns of CNV and a set of weights that describe the
    composition of each sample.  Also provides functions for choosing the optimal tuning
    parameters and the appropriate number of features, and for estimating the false
    discovery rate.
