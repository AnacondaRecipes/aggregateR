  summary: 'Standard error adjusted adaptive lasso (SEA-lasso) is a version of the adaptive lasso,
    which incorporates OLS standard error to the L1 penalty weight. This method is intended
    for variable selection under linear regression settings (n > p). This new weight
    assignment strategy is especially useful when the collinearity of the design matrix
    is a concern. '
