  summary: ' Quaternions and Octonions are four- and eight- dimensional extensions of the complex
    numbers.  They are normed division algebras over the real numbers and find applications
    in spatial rotations (quaternions) and string theory and relativity (octonions).  The
    quaternions are noncommutative and the octonions nonassociative.  See RKS Hankin
    2006, Rnews Volume 6/2: 49-51, and the package vignette, for more details.'
