  summary: This package computes diversity for community data sets using the methods outlined
    by Jost (2006, 2007). While there are differing opinions on the ideal way to calculate
    diversity (e.g. Magurran 2004), this method offers the advantage of providing diversity
    numbers equivalents, independent alpha and beta diversities, and the ability to
    incorporate 'order' (q) as a continuous measure of the importance of rare species
    in the metrics. The functions provided in this package largely correspond with the
    equations offered by Jost in the cited papers. The package computes alpha diversities,
    beta diversities, gamma diversities, and similarity indices. Confidence intervals
    for diversity measures are calculated using a bootstrap method described by Chao
    et al. (2008).  For datasets with many samples (sites, plots), sim.table creates
    tables of all pairwise comparisons possible, and for grouped samples sim.groups
    calculates pairwise combinations of within- and between-group comparisons.
