  summary: 'Utilities for computation and analysis of correlation/co-variation in multiple sequence
    alignments and in side chain motions during molecular dynamics simulations. Features
    include the computation of correlation/co-variation scores using a variety of scoring
    functions between either sequence positions in alignments or side chain dihedral
    angles in molecular dynamics simulations and to analyze the correlation/co-variation
    matrix through a variety of tools including network representation and principal
    components analysis.  In addition, several utility functions are based on the R
    graphical environment to provide friendly tools for help in data interpretation.
