  summary: 'Utilities for computation and analysis of correlation/covariation in multiple sequence
    alignments and in side chain motions during molecular dynamics simulations. Features
    include the computation of correlation/covariation scores using a variety of scoring
    functions between either sequence positions in alignments or side chain dihedral
    angles in molecular dynamics simulations and utilities to analyze the correlation/covariation
    matrix through a variety of tools including network representation and principal
    components analysis. In addition, several utility functions are based on the R graphical
    environment to provide friendly tools for help in data interpretation. Examples
    of sequence covariation analysis are provided in: (1) Pele J, Moreau M, Abdi H,
