  summary: 'The Statistical Package for REliability Data Analysis (SPREDA) implements recently-developed
    statistical methods for the analysis of reliability data. Modern technological developments,
    such as sensors and smart chips, allow us to dynamically track product/system usage
    as well as other environmental variables, such as temperature and humidity. We refer
    to these variables as dynamic covariates. The package contains functions for the
    analysis of time-to-event data with dynamic covariates and degradation data with
    dynamic covariates. The package also contains functions that can be used for analyzing
    time-to-event data with right censoring, and with left truncation and right censoring.
