  summary: Supervised learning using Boltzmann Bayes model inference,  which extends naive Bayes
    model to include interactions. Enables  classification of data into multiple response
    groups based on a large  number of discrete predictors that can take factor values
    of  heterogeneous levels. Either pseudo-likelihood and mean field  inference can
    be used with L2 regularization, cross-validation, and  prediction on new data.  Woo
