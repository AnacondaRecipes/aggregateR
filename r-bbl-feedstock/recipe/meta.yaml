  summary: Supervised learning using Boltzmann Bayes model inference, which extends naive Bayes
    model to include interactions. Enables classification of data into multiple response
    groups based on a large number of discrete predictors that can take factor values
    of heterogeneous levels. Either pseudo-likelihood or mean field inference can be
    used with L2 regularization, cross-validation, and prediction on new data. <doi:10.18637/jss.v101.i05>.
