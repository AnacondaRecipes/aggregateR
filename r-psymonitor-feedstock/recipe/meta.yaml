  summary: Apply the popular real-time monitoring strategy proposed by Phillips, Shi and Yu (2015a,b;PSY)
    <doi:10.1111/iere.12132>, <doi:10.1111/iere.12131>, along with a new bootstrap procedure
    designed to mitigate the potential impact of heteroskedasticity and to effect family-wise
    size control in recursive testing algorithms (Phillips and Shi, forthcoming).
