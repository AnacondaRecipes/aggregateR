  summary: A collection of algorithms and functions to aid statistical modeling. Includes limiting
    dilution analysis (aka ELDA), growth curve comparisons, mixed linear models, heteroscedastic
    regression, inverse-Gaussian probability calculations, Gauss quadrature and a secure
    convergence algorithm for nonlinear models. Also includes advanced generalized linear
    model functions including Tweedie and Digamma distributional families, secure convergence
    and exact distributional calculations for unit deviances.
