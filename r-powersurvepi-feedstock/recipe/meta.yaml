  summary: Functions to calculate power and sample size for testing main effect or interaction
    effect in the survival analysis of epidemiological studies (non-randomized studies),
    taking into account the  correlation between the covariate of the interest and other
    covariates. Some calculations also take  into account the competing risks and stratified
    analysis.  This package also includes a set of functions to calculate power and
    sample size for testing main effect in the survival analysis of  randomized clinical
    trials.
