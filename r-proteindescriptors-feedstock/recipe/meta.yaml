  summary: 'An implementation of protein descriptors in R. These descriptors combine the advantages
    of being fixed length and including partial sequential effect: Various length of
    protein sequences are described with fixed length vectors that are suitable for
    machine learning algorithms, and still includes partial sequential effect.'
