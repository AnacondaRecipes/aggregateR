  summary: Efficient solvers for 10 regularized multi-task learning algorithms applicable for
    regression, classification, joint feature selection, task clustering, low-rank learning,
    sparse learning and network incorporation. Based on the accelerated gradient descent
    method, the algorithms feature a state-of-art computational complexity O(1/k^2).
    Sparse model structure is induced by the solving the proximal operator. The detail
    of the package is described in the paper of Han Cao and Emanuel Schwarz (2018) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty831>.
