  summary: The recovery of visual sensitivity in a dark environment is known as dark adaptation.
    In a clinical or research setting the recovery is typically measured after a dazzling
    flash of light and can be described by the Mahroo, Lamb and Pugh (MLP) model of
    dark adaptation. The functions in this package take dark adaptation data and use
    nonlinear regression to find the parameters of the model that 'best' describe the
    data. They do this by firstly, generating rapid initial objective estimates of data
    adaptation parameters, then a multi-start algorithm is used to reduce the possibility
    of a local minimum. There is also a bootstrap method to calculate parameter confidence
    intervals. The functions rely upon a 'dark' list or object. This object is created
    as the first step in the workflow and parts of the object are updated as it is processed.
