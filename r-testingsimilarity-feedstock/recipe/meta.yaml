  summary: Provides a bootstrap test which decides whether two dose response curves can be assumed
    as equal concerning their maximum absolute deviation. A plenty of choices for the
    model types are available, which can be found in the 'DoseFinding' package, which
    is used for the fitting of the models. See <doi:10.1080/01621459.2017.1281813> for
    details.
