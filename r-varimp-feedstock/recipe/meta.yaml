  summary: Computes the random forest variable importance (VIMP) for the conditional inference
    random forest (cforest) of the 'party' package. Includes a function (varImp) that
    computes the VIMP for arbitrary measures from the 'measures' package. For calculating
    the VIMP regarding the measures accuracy and AUC two extra functions exist (varImpACC
    and varImpAUC).
