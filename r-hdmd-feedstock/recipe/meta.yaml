  summary: High Dimensional Molecular Data (HDMD) typically have many more variables or dimensions
    than observations or replicates (D>>N).  This can cause many statistical procedures
    to fail, become intractable, or produce misleading results.  This package provides
    several tools to reduce dimensionality and analyze biological data for meaningful
    interpretation of results. Factor Analysis (FA), Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
    and Discriminant Analysis (DA) are frequently used multivariate techniques.  However,
    PCA methods prcomp and princomp do not reflect the proportion of total variation
    of each principal component.  Loadings.variation displays the relative and cumulative
    contribution of variation for each component by accounting for all variability in
    data. When D>>N, the maximum likelihood method cannot be applied in FA and the the
    principal axes method must be used instead, as in factor.pa of the psych package.
    The factor.pa.ginv function in this package further allows for a singular covariance
    matrix by applying a general inverse method to estimate factor scores. Moreover,
    factor.pa.ginv removes and warns of any variables that are constant, which would
    otherwise create an invalid covariance matrix. Promax.only further allows users
    to define rotation parameters during factor estimation.  Similar to the Euclidean
    distance, the Mahalanobis distance estimates the relationship among groups.  pairwise.mahalanobis
    computes all such pairwise Mahalanobis distances among groups and is useful for
    quantifying the separation of groups in DA. Genetic sequences are composed of discrete
    alphabetic characters, which makes estimates of variability difficult.  MolecularEntropy
    and MolecularMI calculate the entropy and mutual information to estimate variability
    and covariability, respectively, of DNA or Amino Acid sequences.  Functional grouping
    of amino acids (Atchley et al 1999) is also available for entropy and mutual information
    estimation.  Mutual information values can be normalized by NMI to account for the
    background distribution arising from the stochastic pairing of independent, random
    sites. Alternatively, discrete alphabetic sequences can be transformed into biologically
    informative metrics to be used in various multivariate procedures.  FactorTransform
    converts amino acid sequences using the amino acid indices determined by Atchley
    et al 2005.
