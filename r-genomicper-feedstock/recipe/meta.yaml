  summary: 'Circular genomic permutation approach uses GWAS results to establish the significance
    of pathway/gene-set associations whilst accounting for genomic structure. All SNPs
    in the GWAS are placed in a ''circular genome'' according to their location. Then
    the complete set of SNP association p-values are permuted by rotation with respect
    to the SNPs'' genomic locations. Two testing frameworks are available: permutations
    at the gene level, and permutations at the SNP level. The permutation at the gene
    level uses fisher''s combination test to calculate a single gene p-value, followed
    by the hypergeometric test. The SNP count methodology maps each SNP to pathways/gene-sets
    and calculates the proportion of SNPs for the real and the permutated datasets above
    a pre-defined threshold. Genomicper requires a matrix of GWAS association p-values.
    The SNPs annotation and pathways annotations can be performed within the package
    or provided by the user.'
