  summary: Performs the basic concentration response curve fitting used in the 'tcpl' package.
    It is a substitute for the original tcplFit() function (and sub-functions) and allows
    a wider variety of concentration-response models. All of the models included in
    the 'BMDExpress' package are now part of this package, and the output includes a
    calculation of the bmd (Benchmark Dose or concentration) value.
