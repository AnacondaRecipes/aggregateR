  summary: Contains functions used across packages 'DDIwR', 'QCA' and 'venn'. Interprets and
    translates, factorizes and negates SOP - Sum of Products expressions, for both binary
    and multi-value crisp sets, and extracts information (set names, set values) from
    those expressions. Other functions perform various other checks if possibly numeric
    (even if all numbers reside in a character vector) and coerce to numeric, or check
    if the numbers are whole. It also offers, among many others, a highly versatile
    recoding routine and a more flexible alternative to the base function 'with()'.
    Some of the functions in this package use related functions from package 'QCA'.
    Users are encouraged to install that package despite not being listed in the Imports
    field, due to circular dependency issues.
