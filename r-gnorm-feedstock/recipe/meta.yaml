  summary: Functions for obtaining generalized normal/exponential power distribution probabilities,
    quantiles, densities and random deviates. The generalized normal/exponential power
    distribution was introduced by Subbotin (1923) and rediscovered by Nadarajah (2005).
    The parametrization given by Nadarajah (2005) <doi:10.1080/02664760500079464> is
