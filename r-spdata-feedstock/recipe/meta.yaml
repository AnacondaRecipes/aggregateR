  summary: Diverse spatial datasets for demonstrating, benchmarking and teaching spatial data
    analysis.  It includes R data of class sf (defined by the package 'sf'), Spatial
    ('sp'), and nb ('spdep'). Unlike other spatial data packages such as 'rnaturalearth'
    and 'maps',  it also contains data stored in a range of file formats including GeoJSON,
    ESRI Shapefile and GeoPackage.  Some of the datasets are designed to illustrate
    specific analysis techniques. cycle_hire and cycle_hire_osm, for example, is designed
    to illustrate point pattern analysis techniques.
