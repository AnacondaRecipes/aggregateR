  summary: 'An implementation of a method for building simultaneous confidence intervals for
    the probabilities of a multinomial distribution given a set of observations, proposed
    by Sison and Glaz in their paper: Sison, C.P and J. Glaz. Simultaneous confidence
    intervals and sample size determination for multinomial proportions. Journal of
    the American Statistical Association, 90:366-369 (1995). The method is an R translation
    of the SAS code implemented by May and Johnson in their paper: May, W.L. and W.D.
    Johnson. Constructing two-sided simultaneous confidence intervals for multinomial
    proportions for small counts in a large number of cells. Journal of Statistical
    Software 5(6) (2000). Paper and code available at <DOI:10.18637/jss.v005.i06>.'
