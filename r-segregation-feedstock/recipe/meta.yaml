  summary: Computes entropy-based segregation indices, as developed by Theil (1971) <isbn:978-0471858454>,
    with a focus on the Mutual Information Index (M) and Theil's Information Index (H).
    The M, further described by Mora and Ruiz-Castillo (2011) <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9531.2011.01237.x>
    and Frankel and Volij (2011) <doi:10.1016/j.jet.2010.10.008>, is a measure of segregation
    that is highly decomposable. The package provides tools to decompose the index by
    units and groups (local segregation), and by within and between terms. Includes
    standard error estimation by bootstrapping.
