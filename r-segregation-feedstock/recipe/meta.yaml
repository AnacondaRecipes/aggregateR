  summary: Computes segregation indices, including the Index of Dissimilarity, as well as the
    information-theoretic indices developed by Theil (1971) <isbn:978-0471858454>, namely
    the Mutual Information Index (M) and Theil's Information Index (H). The M, further
    described by Mora and Ruiz-Castillo (2011) <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9531.2011.01237.x>
    and Frankel and Volij (2011) <doi:10.1016/j.jet.2010.10.008>, is a measure of segregation
    that is highly decomposable. The package provides tools to decompose the index by
    units and groups (local segregation), and by within and between terms. The package
    also provides a method to decompose differences in segregation as described by Elbers
    (2021) <doi:10.1177/0049124121986204>. The package includes standard error estimation
    by bootstrapping, which also corrects for small sample bias.
