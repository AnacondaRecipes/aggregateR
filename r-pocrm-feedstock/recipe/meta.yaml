  summary: Provides functions to implement and simulate the partial order continual reassessment
    method (PO-CRM) of Wages, Conaway and O'Quigley (2011) <doi:10.1177/1740774511408748>
    for use in Phase I trials of combinations of agents. Provides a function for generating
    a set of initial guesses (skeleton) for the toxicity probabilities at each combination
    that correspond to the set of possible orderings of the toxicity probabilities specified
    by the user.
