  summary: 'Tools for the statistical modelling of spatial extremes using max-stable processes,
    copula or Bayesian hierarchical models. More precisely, this package allows (conditional)
    simulations from various parametric max-stable models, analysis of the extremal
    spatial dependence, the fitting of such processes using composite likelihoods or
    least square (simple max-stable processes only), model checking and selection and
    prediction. Other approaches (although not completely in agreement with the extreme
    value theory) are available such as the use of (spatial) copula and Bayesian hierarchical
    models assuming the so-called conditional assumptions. The latter approaches is
    handled through an (efficient) Gibbs sampler. Some key references: Davison et al.
