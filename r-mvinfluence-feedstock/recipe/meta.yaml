  summary: Computes regression deletion diagnostics for multivariate linear models and provides
    some associated diagnostic plots.  The diagnostic measures include hat-values (leverages),
    generalized Cook's distance, and generalized squared 'studentized' residuals.  Several
    types of plots to detect influential observations are provided.
