  summary: sbioPN is a package suited to perform simulation of deterministic and stochastic systems
    of biochemical reaction networks with spatial effects. Models are defined using
    a subset of Petri Nets, in a way that is close at how chemical reactions are defined.
    For deterministic solutions, sbioPN creates the associated system of differential
    equations "on the fly", and solves it with a Runge Kutta Dormand Prince 45 explicit
    algorithm. For stochastic solutions, sbioPN offers two variants of Gillespie algorithm,
    or SSA. For hybrid deterministic/stochastic, it employs the Haseltine and Rawlings
    algorithm, that partitions the system in fast and slow reactions. sbioPN algorithms
    are developed in C to achieve adequate performance.
