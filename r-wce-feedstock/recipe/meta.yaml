  summary: A flexible method for modeling cumulative effects of time-varying exposures, weighted
    according to their relative proximity in time, and represented by time-dependent
    covariates. The current implementation estimates the weight function in the Cox
    proportional hazards model. The function that assigns weights to doses taken in
    the past is estimated using cubic regression splines.
