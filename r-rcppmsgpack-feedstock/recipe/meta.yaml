  summary: '''MsgPack'' header files are provided for use by R packages, along  with the ability
    to access, create and alter ''MsgPack'' objects directly from R. ''MsgPack'' is
    an efficient binary serialization format. It lets you exchange data among multiple
    languages like ''JSON'' but it is faster and smaller. Small integers are encoded
    into a single byte, and typical short strings require only one extra byte in addition
    to the strings themselves. This package provides headers from the ''msgpack-c''
    implementation for C and C++(11) for use by R, particularly ''Rcpp''. The included
    ''msgpack-c'' headers are licensed under the Boost Software License (Version 1.0);
    the code added by this package as well the R integration are licensed under the
