  summary: 'Functions for making run charts, Shewhart control charts and Pareto charts for continuous
    quality improvement. Included control charts are: I, MR, Xbar, S, T, C, U, U'',
    P, P'', and G charts. Non-random variation in the form of minor to moderate persistent
    shifts in data over time is identified by the Anhoej rules for unusually long runs
    and unusually few crossing  [Anhoej, Olesen (2014) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0113825>].
    Non-random variation in the form of larger, possibly transient, shifts is identified
    by Shewhart''s 3-sigma rule [Mohammed, Worthington, Woodall (2008) <doi:10.1136/qshc.2004.012047>].'
