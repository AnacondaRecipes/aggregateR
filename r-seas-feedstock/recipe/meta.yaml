  summary: Capable of deriving seasonal statistics, such as "normals", and analysis of seasonal
    data, such as departures. This package also has graphics capabilities for representing
    seasonal data, including boxplots for seasonal parameters, and bars for summed normals.
    There are many specific functions related to climatology, including precipitation
    normals, temperature normals, cumulative precipitation departures and precipitation
    interarrivals. However, this package is designed to represent any time-varying parameter
    with a discernible seasonal signal, such as found in hydrology and ecology.
