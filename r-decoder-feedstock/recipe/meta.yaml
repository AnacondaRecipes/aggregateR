  summary: Main function "decode" is used to decode coded key values to plain text. Function
    "code" can be used to code plain text to code if there is a 1:1 relation between
    the two. The concept relies on 'keyvalue' objects used for translation. There are
    several 'keyvalue' objects included in the areas of geographical regional codes,
    administrative health care unit codes, diagnosis codes and more. It is also easy
    to extend the use by arbitrary code sets.
