  summary: General (multi-allelic) Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium problem from an objective Bayesian
    testing standpoint. This aim is achieved through the identification of a class of
    priors specifically designed for this testing problem. A class of intrinsic priors
    under the full model is considered. This class is indexed by a tuning quantity,
    the training sample size, as discussed in Consonni, Moreno and Venturini (2010).
    These priors are objective, satisfy Savage's continuity condition and have proved
    to behave extremely well for many statistical testing problems.
