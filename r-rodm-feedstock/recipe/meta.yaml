  summary: This package implements an interface to Oracle Data Mining (ODM). It provides an ideal
    environment for rapid development of demos and proof of concept data mining studies.
    It facilitates the prototyping of vertical applications and makes ODM and the RDBMS
    environment easily accessible to statisticians and data analysts familiar with R
    but not fluent in SQL or familiar with the database environment. It also facilitates
    the benchmarking and testing of ODM functionality including the production of summary
    statistics, performance metrics and graphics. It enables the scripting and control
    of production data mining methodologies from a high-level environment. Oracle Data
    Mining (ODM) is an option of Oracle Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
    Enterprise Edition (EE). It contains several data mining and data analysis algorithms
    for classification, prediction, regression, clustering, associations, feature selection,
    anomaly detection, feature extraction, and specialized analytics. It provides means
    for the creation, management and operational deployment of data mining models inside
    the database environment. For more information consult the entry for "Oracle Data
    Mining" in Wikipedia (en.wikipedia.org).
