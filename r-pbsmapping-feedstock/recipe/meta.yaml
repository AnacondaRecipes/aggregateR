  summary: This software has evolved from fisheries research conducted at the Pacific Biological
    Station (PBS) in 'Nanaimo', British Columbia, Canada. It extends the R language
    to include two-dimensional plotting features similar to those commonly available
    in a Geographic Information System (GIS). Embedded C code speeds algorithms from
    computational geometry, such as finding polygons that contain specified point events
    or converting between longitude-latitude and Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
    coordinates. Additionally, we include 'C++' code developed by Angus Johnson for
    the 'Clipper' library, data for a global shoreline, and other data sets in the public
    domain. Under the user's R library directory '.libPaths()', specifically in './PBSmapping/doc',
    a complete user's guide is offered and should be consulted to use package functions
    effectively.
