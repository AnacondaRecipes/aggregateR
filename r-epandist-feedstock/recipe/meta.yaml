  summary: Analyzing censored variables usually requires the use of optimization algorithms.
    This package provides an alternative algebraic approach to the task of determining
    the expected value of a random censored variable with a known censoring point. Likewise
    this approach allows for the determination of the censoring point if the expected
    value is known. These results are derived under the assumption that the variable
    follows an Epanechnikov kernel distribution with known mean and range prior to censoring.
    Statistical functions related to the uncensored Epanechnikov distribution are also
    provided by this package.
