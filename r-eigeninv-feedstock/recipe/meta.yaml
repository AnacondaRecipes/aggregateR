  summary: Solves the ``inverse eigenvalue problem'' which is to generate a real-valued matrix
    that has the specified real eigenvalue spectrum.  It can generate infinitely many
    dense matrices, symmetric or asymmetric, with the given set of eigenvalues.  Algorithm
    can also generate stochastic and doubly stochastic matrices.
