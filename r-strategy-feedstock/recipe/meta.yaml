  summary: Users can build and test customized quantitative trading strategies. Some quantitative
    trading strategies are already implemented, e.g. various moving-average filters
    with trend following approaches. The implemented class called "Strategy" allows
    users to access several methods to analyze performance figures, plots and backtest
    the strategies. Furthermore, custom strategies can be added, a generic template
    is available. The custom strategies require a certain input and output so they can
    be called from the Strategy-constructor.
