  summary: Ordered models such as ordered probit and ordered logit presume that the error variance
    is constant across observations. In the case that this assumption does not hold
    estimates of marginal effects are typically biased (Weiss (1997)). This package
    allows for generalization of ordered probit and ordered logit models by allowing
    the user to specify a model for the variance. Furthermore, the package includes
    functions to calculate the marginal effects. Wrapper functions to estimate the standard
    limited dependent variable models are also included.
