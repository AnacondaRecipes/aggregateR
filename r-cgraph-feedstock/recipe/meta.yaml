  summary: Allows to create, evaluate, and differentiate computational graphs in R. A computational
    graph is a graph representation of a multivariate function decomposed by its (elementary)
    operations. Nodes in the graph represent arrays while edges represent dependencies
    among the arrays. An advantage of expressing a function as a computational graph
    is that this enables to differentiate the function by automatic differentiation.
    The 'cgraph' package supports various operations including basic arithmetic, trigonometry
    operations, and linear algebra operations. It differentiates computational graphs
    by reverse automatic differentiation. The flexible architecture of the package makes
    it applicable to solve a variety of problems including local sensitivity analysis,
    gradient-based optimization, and machine learning.
