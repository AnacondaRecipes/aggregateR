  summary: This implements the methods developed in, L. Bybee and Y. Atchade. (2018).  Contains
    a series of methods for estimating change-points given user specified black-box
    models.  The methods include binary segmentation for multiple change-point estimation.
    For estimating each individual change-point the package includes simulated annealing,
    brute force, and, for Gaussian graphical models, an applications specific rank-one
    update implementation.  Additionally, code for estimating Gaussian graphical models
    is included.  The goal of this package is to allow for the efficient estimation
    of change-points in complicated models with high dimensional data.
