  summary: Various tools for microeconomic analysis and microeconomic modelling, e.g. estimating
    quadratic, Cobb-Douglas and Translog functions, calculating partial derivatives
    and elasticities of these functions, and calculating Hessian matrices, checking
    curvature and preparing restrictions for imposing monotonicity of Translog functions.
