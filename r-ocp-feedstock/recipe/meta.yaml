  summary: Implements the Bayesian online changepoint detection method by Adams and MacKay (2007)
    <arXiv:0710.3742> for univariate or multivariate data. Gaussian and Poisson probability
    models are implemented. Provides post-processing functions with alternative ways
    to extract changepoints.
