  summary: Performs a permutation test on the difference between two location parameters, a permutation
    correlation test, a permutation F-test, the Siegel-Tukey test, a ratio mean deviance
    test.  Also performs some graphing techniques, such as for confidence intervals,
    vector addition, and Fourier analysis; and includes functions related to the Laplace
    (double exponential) and triangular distributions.  Performs power calculations
    for the binomial test.
