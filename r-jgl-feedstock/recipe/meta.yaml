  summary: 'The Joint Graphical Lasso is a generalized method for estimating Gaussian graphical
    models/ sparse inverse covariance matrices/ biological networks on multiple classes
    of data.  We solve JGL under two penalty functions: The Fused Graphical Lasso (FGL),
    which employs a fused penalty to encourage inverse covariance matrices to be similar
    across classes, and the Group Graphical Lasso (GGL), which encourages similar network
    structure between classes.  FGL is recommended over GGL for most applications. Reference:
