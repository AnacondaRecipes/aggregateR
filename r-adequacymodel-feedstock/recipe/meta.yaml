  summary: The main application concerns to a new robust optimization package with two major
    contributions. The first contribution refers to the assessment of the adequacy of
    probabilistic models through a combination of several statistics, which measure
    the relative quality of statistical models for a given data set. The second one
    provides a general purpose optimization method based on meta-heuristics functions
    for maximizing or minimizing an arbitrary objective function.
