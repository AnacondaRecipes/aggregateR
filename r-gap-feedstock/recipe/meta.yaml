  summary: 'As first reported [Zhao, J. H. 2007. "gap: Genetic Analysis Package". J Stat Soft
    23(8):1-18. <doi:10.18637/jss.v023.i08>], it is designed as an integrated package
    for genetic data analysis of both population and family data. Currently, it contains
    functions for sample size calculations of both population-based and family-based
    designs, probability of familial disease aggregation, kinship calculation, statistics
    in linkage analysis, and association analysis involving genetic markers including
    haplotype analysis with or without environmental covariates. Over years, the package
    has been developed in-between many projects hence also in line with the name (gap).'
