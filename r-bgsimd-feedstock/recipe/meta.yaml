  summary: Implement an efficient block Gibbs sampler with incomplete data from a multinomial
    distribution taking values from the k categories 1,2,...,k, where data are assumed
    to miss at random and each missing datum belongs to one and only one of m distinct
    non-empty proper subsets A1, A2,..., Am of 1,2,...,k and the k categories are labelled
    such that only consecutive A's may overlap.
