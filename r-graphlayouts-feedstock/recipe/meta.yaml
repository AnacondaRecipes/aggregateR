  summary: Several new layout algorithms to visualize networks are provided which are not part
    of 'igraph'. Most are based on the concept of stress majorization by Gansner et
    al. (2004) <doi:10.1007/978-3-540-31843-9_25>. Some more specific algorithms allow
    the user to emphasize hidden group structures in networks or focus on specific nodes.
