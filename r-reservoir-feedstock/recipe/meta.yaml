  summary: Measure single-storage water supply system performance using resilience, reliability,
    and vulnerability metrics; assess storage-yield-reliability relationships; determine
    no-fail storage with sequent peak analysis; optimize release decisions for water
    supply, hydropower, and multi-objective reservoirs using deterministic and stochastic
    dynamic programming; generate inflow replicates using parametric and non-parametric
    models; evaluate inflow persistence using the Hurst coefficient.
