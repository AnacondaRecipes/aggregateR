  summary: Methods for aggregating ranked lists, especially lists of genes. It implements the
    Robust Rank Aggregation Kolde et al (2012) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btr709> and
    some other simple algorithms for the task. RRA method uses a probabilistic model
    for aggregation that is robust to noise and also facilitates the calculation of
    significance probabilities for all the elements in the final ranking.
