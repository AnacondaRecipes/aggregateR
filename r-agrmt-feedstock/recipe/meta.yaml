  summary: 'Calculates concentration and dispersion in ordered rating scales. It implements various
    measures of concentration and dispersion to describe what researchers variably call
    agreement, concentration, consensus, dispersion, or polarization among respondents
    in ordered data. It also implements other related measures to classify distributions.
    In addition to a generic city-block based concentration measure and a generic dispersion
    measure, the package implements various measures, including van der Eijk''s (2001)
    <DOI: 10.1023/A:1010374114305> measure of agreement A, measures of concentration
    by Leik, Tatsle and Wierman, Blair and Lacy, Kvalseth, Berry and Mielke, Reardon,
    and Garcia-Montalvo and Reynal-Querol. Furthermore, the package provides an implementation
    of Galtungs AJUS-system to classify distributions, as well as a function to identify
    the position of multiple modes.'
