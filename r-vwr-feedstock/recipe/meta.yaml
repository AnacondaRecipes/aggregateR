  summary: 'Functions and data for use in visual word recognition research:  Computation of neighbors
    (Hamming and Levenshtein distances), average distances to neighbors (e.g., OLD20),
    and Coltheart''s N. Also includes the LD1NN algorithm to detect bias in the composition
    of a lexical decision task. Most of the functions support parallel execution. Supplies
    wordlists for  several languages. Uses the string distance functions from the stringdist
    package by Mark van der Loo.'
