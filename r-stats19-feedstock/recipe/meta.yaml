  summary: Tools to help download, process and analyse the UK road collision data collected using
    the 'STATS19' form. The data are provided as 'CSV' files with detailed road safety
    data about the circumstances of car crashes and other incidents on the roads resulting
    in casualties in Great Britain from 1979, the types (including make and model) of
    vehicles involved and the consequential casualties.  The statistics relate only
    to personal casualties on public roads that are reported to the police, and subsequently
    recorded, using the 'STATS19' accident reporting form. See the Department for Transport
    website <https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data>
