  summary: Transforming univariate non-normal data to normality using Johnson  families of distributions.
    Johnson family is a comprehensive distribution  family that accommodates many kinds
    of non-normal distributions. A bunch of  distributions with various parameters will
    be fit and the corresponding  p-values under a user-specified normality test will
    be given. The final  transformation will be the one with the largest p-value under
    the given  normality test.
