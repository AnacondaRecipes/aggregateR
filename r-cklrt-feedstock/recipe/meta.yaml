  summary: 'Composite Kernel Machine Regression based on Likelihood Ratio Test (CKLRT): in this
    package, we develop a kernel machine regression framework to model the overall genetic
    effect of a SNP-set, considering the possible GE interaction. Specifically, we use
    a composite kernel to specify the overall genetic effect via a nonparametric function
    and we model additional covariates parametrically within the regression framework.
    The composite kernel is constructed as a weighted average of two kernels, one corresponding
    to the genetic main effect and one corresponding to the GE interaction effect. We
    propose a likelihood ratio test (LRT) and a restricted likelihood ratio test (RLRT)
    for statistical significance. We derive a Monte Carlo approach for the finite sample
    distributions of LRT and RLRT statistics. (N. Zhao, H. Zhang, J. Clark, A. Maity,
