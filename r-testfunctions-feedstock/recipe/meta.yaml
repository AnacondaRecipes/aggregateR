  summary: Test functions are often used to test computer code. They are used in optimization
    to test algorithms and in metamodeling to evaluate model predictions. This package
    provides test functions that can be used for any purpose. Some functions are taken
    from <https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano>, but their R code is not used.
