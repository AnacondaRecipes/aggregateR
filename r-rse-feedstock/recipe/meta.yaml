  summary: 'A Bayesian-weighted estimator and two unweighted estimators are developed to estimate
    the number of newly found rare species in additional ecological samples. Among these
    methods, the Bayesian-weighted estimator and an unweighted (Chao-derived) estimator
    are of high accuracy and recommended for practical applications. Technical details
    of the proposed estimators have been well described in the following paper: Shen
    TJ, Chen YH (2018) A Bayesian weighted approach to predicting the number of newly
    discovered rare species. Conservation Biology, In press.'
