  summary: Presents an explanatory animation of normal quantile-quantile plots based on a water-filling
    analogy.  The animation presents a normal QQ plot as the parametric plot of the
    water levels in vases defined by two distributions.  The distributions decorate
    the axes in the normal QQ plot and are optionally shown as vases adjacent to the
    plot.  The package draws QQ plots for several distributions, either as samples or
    continuous functions.
