  summary: The basic idea of latent semantic analysis (LSA) is, that text do have a higher order
    (=latent semantic) structure which, however, is obscured by word usage (e.g. through
    the use of synonyms or polysemy). By using conceptual indices that are derived statistically
    via a truncated singular value decomposition (a two-mode factor analysis) over a
    given document-term matrix, this variability problem can be overcome.
