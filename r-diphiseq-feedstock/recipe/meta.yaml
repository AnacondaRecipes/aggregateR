  summary: 'Implements the algorithm described in Jun Li and Alicia T. Lamere, "DiPhiSeq: Robust
    comparison of expression levels on RNA-Seq data with large sample sizes"  (Unpublished).
    Detects not only genes that show different average expressions ("differential expression",
    DE), but also genes that show different diversities of expressions in different
    groups ("differentially dispersed", DD). DD genes can be important clinical markers.
    ''DiPhiSeq'' uses a redescending penalty on the quasi-likelihood function, and thus
    has superior robustness against outliers and other noise. Updates from version 0.1.0:
    (1) Added the option of using adaptive initial value for phi. (2) Added a function
    for estimating the proportion of outliers in the data. (3) Modified the input parameter
    names for clarity, and modified the output format for the main function.'
