  summary: A minimum distance estimator is calculated for an imprecise probability model. The
    imprecise probability model consists of upper coherent previsions whose credal sets
    are given by a finite number of constraints on the expectations. The parameter set
    is finite. The estimator chooses that parameter such that the empirical measure
    lies next to the corresponding credal set with respect to the total variation norm.
