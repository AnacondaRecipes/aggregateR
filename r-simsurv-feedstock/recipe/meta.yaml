  summary: Simulate survival times from standard parametric survival  distributions (exponential,
    Weibull, Gompertz), 2-component mixture  distributions, or a user-defined hazard,
    log hazard, cumulative hazard, or log cumulative hazard function. Baseline covariates
    can be included  under a proportional hazards assumption.  Time dependent effects
    (i.e. non-proportional hazards) can be included by  interacting covariates with
    linear time or a user-defined function of time. Clustered event times are also accommodated.  The
    2-component mixture distributions can allow for a variety of flexible baseline hazard
    functions reflecting those seen in practice.  If the user wishes to provide a user-defined  hazard
    or log hazard function then this is possible, and the resulting cumulative hazard
    function does not need to have a closed-form solution.  Note that this package is
    modelled on the 'survsim' package available in  the 'Stata' software (see Crowther
    and Lambert (2012)  <http://www.stata-journal.com/sjpdf.html?articlenum=st0275>
    or  Crowther and Lambert (2013) <doi:10.1002/sim.5823>).
