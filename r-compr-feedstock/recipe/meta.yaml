  summary: Different tools for describing and analysing paired comparison data are presented.
    Main methods are estimation of products scores according Bradley Terry Luce model.
    A segmentation of the individual could be conducted on the basis of a mixture distribution
    approach. The number of classes can be tested by the use of Monte Carlo simulations.
    This package deals also with multi-criteria paired comparison data.
