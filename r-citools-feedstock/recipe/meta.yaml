  summary: Functions to append confidence intervals, prediction intervals, and other quantities
    of interest to data frames. All appended quantities are for the response variable,
    after conditioning on the model and covariates. This package has a data frame first
    syntax that allows for easy piping. Currently supported models include (log-) linear,
    (log-) linear mixed, generalized linear models, generalized linear mixed models,
    and accelerated failure time models.
