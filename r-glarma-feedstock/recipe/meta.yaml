  summary: Functions are provided for estimation, testing, diagnostic checking and forecasting
    of generalized linear autoregressive moving average (GLARMA) models for discrete
    valued time series with regression variables.  These are a class of observation
    driven non-linear non-Gaussian state space models. The state vector consists of
    a linear regression component plus an observation driven component consisting of
    an autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) filter of past predictive residuals. Currently
    three distributions (Poisson, negative binomial and binomial) can be used for the
    response series. Three options (Pearson, score-type and unscaled) for the residuals
    in the observation driven component are available. Estimation is via maximum likelihood
    (conditional on initializing values for the ARMA process) optimized using Fisher
    scoring or Newton Raphson iterative methods. Likelihood ratio and Wald tests for
    the observation driven component allow testing for serial dependence in generalized
    linear model settings. Graphical diagnostics including model fits, autocorrelation
    functions and probability integral transform residuals are included in the package.
    Several standard data sets are included in the package.
