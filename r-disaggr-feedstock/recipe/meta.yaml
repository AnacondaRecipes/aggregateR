  summary: "The twoStepsBenchmark() and threeRuleSmooth() functions allow you to disaggregate
    a low-frequency time series with higher frequency time series, using the French
    National Accounts methodology. The aggregated sum of the resulting time series is
    strictly equal to the low-frequency time series within the benchmarking window.
    Typically, the low-frequency time series is an annual one, unknown for the last
