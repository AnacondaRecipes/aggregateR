    measures as mentioned in Chen and Martin (2018) <https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3085672>,
    as well as in Zhang et al. (2019) <https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3415903>. Also
    evaluates estimators influence functions at a set of parameter values and plots
    them to display the shapes of the influence functions.
