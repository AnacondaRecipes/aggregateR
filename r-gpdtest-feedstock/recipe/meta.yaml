  summary: This package computes the bootstrap goodness-of-fit test for the generalized Pareto
    distribution by Villasenor-Alva and Gonzalez-Estrada (2009). The null hypothesis
    includes heavy and non-heavy tailed gPd's. A function for fitting the gPd to data
    using the parameter estimation methods proposed in the same article is also provided.
