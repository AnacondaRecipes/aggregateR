  summary: Implement K-nearest neighbor classifier, weighted nearest neighbor classifier, bagged
    nearest neighbor classifier, optimal weighted nearest neighbor classifier and stabilized
    nearest neighbor classifier, and perform model selection via 5 fold cross-validation
    for them. This package also provides functions for computing the classification
    error and classification instability of a classification procedure.
