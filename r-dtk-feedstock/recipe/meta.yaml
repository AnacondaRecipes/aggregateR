  summary: 'This package was created to analyze multi-level one-way experimental designs. It
    is designed to handle vectorized observation and factor data where there are unequal
    sample sizes and population variance homogeneity can not be assumed. To conduct
    the Dunnett modified Tukey-Kramer test (a.k.a. the T3 Procedure), create two vectors:
    one for your observations and one for the factor level of each observation. The
    function, gl.unequal, provides a means to more conveniently produce a factor vector
    with unequal sample sizes. Next, use the DTK.test function to conduct the test and
    save the output as an object to input into the DTK.plot function, which produces
    a confidence interval plot for each of the pairwise comparisons. Lastly, the function
    TK.test conducts the original Tukey-Kramer test.'
