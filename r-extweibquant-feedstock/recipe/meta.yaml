  summary: It implements the subjectively censored Weibull MLE and censored Weibull mixture methods
    for the lower quantile estimation. Quantile estimates from these two methods are
    robust to model misspecification in the lower tail. It also includes functions to
    evaluation the standard error of the resulting quantile estimates. Also, the methods
    here can be used to fit the Weibull or Weibull mixture for the Type-I or Type-II
    right censored data.
