  summary: Bayesian Mixture Survival Models using Additive Mixture-of-Weibull Hazards, with Lasso
    Shrinkage and Stratification. As a Bayesian dynamic survival model, it relaxes the
    proportional-hazard assumption. Lasso shrinkage controls overfitting, given the
    increase in the number of free parameters in the model due to presence of two Weibull
    components in the hazard function.
