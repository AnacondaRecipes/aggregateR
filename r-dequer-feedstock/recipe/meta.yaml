  summary: Queues, stacks, and 'deques' are list-like, abstract data types. These are meant to
    be very cheap to "grow", or insert new objects into. A typical use case involves
    storing data in a list in a streaming fashion, when you do not necessarily know
    how may elements need to be stored. Unlike R's lists, the new data structures provided
    here are not necessarily stored contiguously, making insertions and deletions at
    the front/end of the structure much faster.  The underlying implementation is new
    and uses a head/tail doubly linked list; thus, we do not rely on R's environments
    or hashing.  To avoid unnecessary data copying, most operations on these data structures
    are performed via side-effects.
