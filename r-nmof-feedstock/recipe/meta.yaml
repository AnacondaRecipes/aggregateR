  summary: Functions, examples and data from the first and the second edition of "Numerical Methods
    and Optimization in Finance" by M. Gilli, D. Maringer and E. Schumann (2019, ISBN:978-0128150658).  The
    package provides implementations of optimisation heuristics (Differential Evolution,
    Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimisation, Simulated Annealing and Threshold
    Accepting), and other optimisation tools, such as grid search and greedy search.  There
    are also functions for the valuation of financial instruments such as bonds and
    options, for portfolio selection and functions that help with stochastic simulations.
