  summary: Functions, examples and data from the book "Numerical Methods and Optimization in
    Finance" by M. Gilli, D. Maringer and E. Schumann (2011), ISBN 978-0123756626. The
    package provides implementations of several optimisation heuristics, such as Differential
    Evolution, Genetic Algorithms and Threshold Accepting. There are also functions
    for the valuation of financial instruments, such as bonds and options, and functions
    that help with stochastic simulations.
