  summary: Package for analysis of simple experimental designs (CRD, RBD and LSD), experiments
    in double factorial schemes (in CRD and RBD), experiments in a split plot in time
    schemes (in CRD and RBD), experiments in double factorial schemes with an additional
    treatment (in CRD and RBD), experiments in triple factorial scheme (in CRD and RBD)
    and experiments in triple factorial schemes with an additional treatment (in CRD
    and RBD), performing the analysis of variance and means comparison by fitting regression
    models until the third power (quantitative treatments) or by a multiple comparison
    test, Tukey test, test  of Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK), Scott-Knott, Duncan test,
    t test (LSD) and Bonferroni t test (protected LSD) - for qualitative treatments;
    residual analysis (Ferreira, Cavalcanti and Nogueira, 2014) <doi:10.4236/am.2014.519280>.
