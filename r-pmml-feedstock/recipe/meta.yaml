  summary: The Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) is an XML-based language which provides
    a way for applications to define machine learning, statistical and data mining models
    and to share models between PMML compliant applications. More information about
    the PMML industry standard and the Data Mining Group can be found at <http://dmg.org/>.
    The generated PMML can be imported into any PMML consuming application, such as
    Zementis Predictive Analytics products. The package isofor (used for anomaly detection)
    can be installed with devtools::install_github("gravesee/isofor").
