  summary: The Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) is an XML-based language which provides
    a way for applications to define machine learning, statistical and data mining models
    and to share models between PMML compliant applications. More information about
    the PMML industry standard and the Data Mining Group can be found at <http://www.dmg.org>.
    The generated PMML can be imported into any PMML consuming application, such as
    Zementis Predictive Analytics products, which integrate with web services, relational
    database systems and deploy natively on Hadoop in conjunction with Hive, Spark or
    Storm, as well as allow predictive analytics to be executed for IBM z Systems mainframe
    applications and real-time, streaming analytics platforms. The package isofor (used
    for anomaly detection) can be installed with devtools::install_github("Zelazny7/isofor").
