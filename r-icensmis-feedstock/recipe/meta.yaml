  summary: 'We consider studies in which information from error-prone diagnostic tests or self-reports
    are gathered sequentially to determine the occurrence of a silent event. Using a
    likelihood-based approach incorporating the proportional hazards assumption, we
    provide functions to estimate the survival distribution and covariate effects. We
    also provide functions for power and sample size calculations for this setting.
