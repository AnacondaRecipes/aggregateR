  summary: 'The centre of mass is a crucial data for arborists in order to consolidate a tree
    using steel or dynamic cables. Given field-recorded data on branchiness of a tree,
    the package: (i) computes and plots the centre of mass of the tree itself, (ii)
    computes branches slenderness coefficient in order to aid the arborist identify
    potentially dangerous branches, and (iii) computes the force acting on a ground
    plinth and its best position relating to the tree centre of mass, should the tree
    need to be stabilized by a steel cable.'
