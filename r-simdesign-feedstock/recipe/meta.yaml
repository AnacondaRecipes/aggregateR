  summary: Provides tools to safely and efficiently organize and execute Monte Carlo simulation
    experiments in R. The package controls the structure and back-end of Monte Carlo
    simulation experiments by utilizing a generate-analyse-summarise workflow. The workflow
    safeguards against common simulation coding issues, such as automatically re-simulating
    non-convergent results, prevents inadvertently overwriting simulation files, catches
    error and warning messages during execution, and implicitly supports parallel processing.
    For a pedagogical introduction to the package see Sigal and Chalmers (2016) <doi:10.1080/10691898.2016.1246953>.
    For a more in-depth overview of the package and its design philosophy see Chalmers
    and Adkins (2020) <doi:10.20982/tqmp.16.4.p248>.
