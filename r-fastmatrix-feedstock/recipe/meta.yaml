  summary: Small set of functions to fast computation of some matrices and operations useful
    in statistics and econometrics. Currently, there are functions for efficient computation
    of duplication, commutation and symmetrizer matrices with minimal storage requirements.
    Some commonly used matrix decompositions (LU and LDL), basic matrix operations (for
    instance, Hadamard, Kronecker products and the Sherman-Morrison formula) and iterative
    solvers for linear systems are also available. In addition, the package includes
    a number of common statistical procedures such as the sweep operator, weighted mean
    and covariance matrix using an online algorithm, linear regression (using Cholesky,
    QR, SVD, sweep operator and conjugate gradients methods), ridge regression (with
    optimal selection of the ridge parameter considering several procedures), omnibus
    tests for univariate normality, functions to compute the multivariate skewness,
    kurtosis, the Mahalanobis distance (checking the positive defineteness), and the
    Wilson-Hilferty transformation of chi squared variables. Furthermore, the package
    provides interfaces to C code callable by another C code from other R packages.
