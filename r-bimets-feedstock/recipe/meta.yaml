  summary: Time series analysis, (dis)aggregation and manipulation, e.g. time series extension,
    merge, projection, lag, lead, delta, moving and cumulative average and product,
    selection by index, date and year-period, conversion to daily, monthly, quarterly,
    (semi)annually. Simultaneous equation models definition, estimation, simulation
    and forecasting with coefficient restrictions, error autocorrelation, exogenization,
    add-factors, impact and interim multipliers analysis, conditional equation evaluation,
    endogenous targeting and model renormalization.
