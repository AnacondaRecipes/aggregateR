  summary: Density, distribution function, quantile function and random generation for the Generalized
    Binomial Distribution. Functions to compute the Clopper-Pearson Confidence Interval
    and the required sample size. Enhanced model for burn-in studies, where failures
    are tackled by countermeasures.
