  summary: 'The function pointdensity returns a density count and the temporal average for every
    point in the original list. The dataframe returned includes four columns: lat, lon,
    count, and date_avg. The "lat" column is the original latitude data; the "lon" column
    is the original longitude data; the "count" is the density count of the number of
    points within a radius of radius*grid_size (the neighborhood); and the date_avg
    column includes the average date of each point in the neighborhood.'
