  summary: Provides a routine to concentrate out factors with many levels during the optimization
    of the log-likelihood function of the corresponding generalized linear model (glm).
    The package is based on the algorithm proposed by Stammann (2018) <arXiv:1707.01815>
    and is restricted to glm's that are based on maximum likelihood estimation and non-linear.
    It also offers an efficient algorithm to recover estimates of the fixed effects
    in a post-estimation routine and  includes robust and multi-way clustered standard
    errors. Further the package provides an  analytical bias-correction for binary choice
    models (logit and probit) derived by Fernandez-Val  and Weidner (2016) <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2015.12.014>.
