  summary: Assume that a temporal process is composed of contiguous segments with differing slopes
    and replicated noise-corrupted time series measurements are observed. The unknown
    mean of the data generating process is modelled as a piecewise linear function of
    time with an unknown number of change-points. The package infers the joint posterior
    distribution of the number and position of change-points as well as the unknown
    mean parameters per time-series by MCMC sampling. A-priori, the proposed model uses
    an overfitting number of mean parameters but, conditionally on a set of change-points,
    only a subset of them influences the likelihood. An exponentially decreasing prior
    distribution on the number of change-points gives rise to a posterior distribution
    concentrating on sparse representations of the underlying sequence, but also available
    is the Poisson distribution. See Papastamoulis et al (2017) <arXiv:1709.06111> for
    a detailed presentation of the method.
