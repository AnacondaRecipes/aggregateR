  summary: The DnE package involves functions to analyse the distribution of a set of given data.
    The basic idea of the analysis is chi-squared test. Functions which have the form
    as "is.xxdistribution" are used to analyse whether the data obeys the xxdistrbution.
    If you do not know which distribution to judge, use function is.dt().
