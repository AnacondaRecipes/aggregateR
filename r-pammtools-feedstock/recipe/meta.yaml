  summary: 'The Piece-wise exponential (Additive Mixed) Model (PAMM; Bender and others (2018)
    <doi: 10.1177/1471082X17748083>) is a powerful model class for the analysis of survival
    (or time-to-event) data, based on Generalized Additive (Mixed) Models (GA(M)Ms).
    It offers intuitive specification and robust estimation of complex survival models
    with stratified baseline hazards, random effects, time-varying effects, time-dependent
    covariates and cumulative effects (Bender and others (2019)), as well as support
    for left-truncated, competing risks and recurrent events data. pammtools provides
    tidy workflow for survival analysis with PAMMs, including data simulation, transformation
    and other functions for data preprocessing and model post-processing as well as
    visualization.'
