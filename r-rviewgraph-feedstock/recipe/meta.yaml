  summary: This is an 'R' interface to Alun Thomas's 'ViewGraph' 'Java' graph viewing program.
    It takes a graph specified as an incidence matrix, list of edges, or in 'igraph'
    format and runs a graphical user interface that shows an animation of a force directed
    algorithm positioning the vertices in two dimensions. It works well for graphs of
    various structure of up to a few thousand vertices. It's not fazed by graphs that
    comprise several components. The coordinates can be read as an 'igraph' style layout  matrix
    at any time. The user can mess with the layout using a mouse,  preferably one with
    3 buttons, and some keyed commands. The 'Java' program 'ViewGraph' is contained
    in Alun Thomas's 'JPSGCS'  collection of 'Java' programs for statistical genetics
    and computational  statistics. The homepage for 'JPSGCS' is  <http://www-genepi.med.utah.edu/~alun/software/index.html>.
    The documentation page for 'ViewGraph' is at  <http://www-genepi.med.utah.edu/~alun/software/docs/ViewGraph.html>.
