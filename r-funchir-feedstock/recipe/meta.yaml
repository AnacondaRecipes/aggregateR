  summary: YACFP (Yet Another Convenience Function Package). get_age() is a fast & accurate tool
    for measuring fractional years between two dates. abbr_to_colClass() is a much more
    concise way of feeding many types to a colClass argument in a data reader. stale_package_check()
    tries to identify any library() calls to unused packages.
