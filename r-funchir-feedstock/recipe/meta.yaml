  summary: A set of functions, some subset of which I use in every .R file I write. Examples
    are table2(), which adds useful functionalities to base table (sorting, built-in
    proportion argument, etc.); lyx.xtable(), which converts xtable() output to a format
    more easily copy-pasted into LyX; pdf2(), which writes a plot to file while also
    displaying it in the RStudio plot window; and abbr_to_colClass(), which is a much
    more concise way of feeding many types to a colClass argument in a data reader.
