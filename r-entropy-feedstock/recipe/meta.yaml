  summary: Implements various estimators of entropy for discrete random variables, including
    the shrinkage estimator by Hausser and Strimmer (2009), the maximum likelihood and
    the Millow-Madow estimator, various Bayesian estimators, and the Chao-Shen estimator.  It
    also offers an R interface to the NSB estimator.  Furthermore, the package provides
    functions for estimating the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the chi-squared divergence,
    mutual information, and the chi-squared divergence of independence.  It also computes
    the G statistic and the chi-squared statistic and corresponding p-values. Furthermore,
    there are functions for discretizing continuous random variables.
