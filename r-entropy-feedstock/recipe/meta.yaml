  summary: This package implements various estimators of entropy, such as the shrinkage estimator
    by Hausser and Strimmer, the maximum likelihood  and the Millow-Madow estimator,
    various Bayesian estimators, and the  Chao-Shen estimator.  It also offers an R
    interface to the NSB estimator. Furthermore, it provides functions for estimating
    Kullback-Leibler divergence, chi-squared, mutual information, and chi-squared statistic
    of independence. In addition there are functions for discretizing continuous random
    variables.
