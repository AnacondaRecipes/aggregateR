  summary: Implement the Tariff algorithm for coding cause-of-death from verbal autopsies. The
    Tariff method was originally proposed in James et al (2011) <DOI:10.1186/1478-7954-9-31>
    and later refined as Tariff 2.0 in Serina, et al. (2015) <DOI:10.1186/s12916-015-0527-9>.
    Note that this package was not developed by authors affiliated with the Institute
    for Health Metrics and Evaluation and thus unintentional discrepancies may exist
    between the this implementation and the implementation available from IHME.
