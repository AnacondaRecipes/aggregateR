  summary: The deltaPlotR package implements Angoff's Delta Plot method to detect dichotomous
    DIF. Several detection thresholds are included, either from multivariate normality
    assumption or by prior determination. Item purification is supported (Magis and
    Facon (2014) <doi:10.18637/jss.v059.c01>).
