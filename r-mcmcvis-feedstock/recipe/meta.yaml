  summary: Performs key functions for MCMC analysis using minimal code - visualizes, manipulates,
    and summarizes MCMC output. Functions support simple and straightforward subsetting
    of model parameters within the calls, and produce presentable and 'publication-ready'
    output. MCMC output may be derived from Bayesian model output fit with 'Stan', 'NIMBLE',
    'JAGS', and other software.
