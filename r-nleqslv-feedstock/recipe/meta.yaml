  summary: Solve a system of nonlinear equations using a Broyden or a Newton method with a choice
    of global strategies such as line search and trust region. There are options for
    using a numerical or user supplied Jacobian, for specifying a banded numerical Jacobian
    and for allowing a singular or ill-conditioned Jacobian.
