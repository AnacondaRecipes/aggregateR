  summary: For the implementation of the step-down or step-up Dunnett testing procedures, the
    package includes R functions to calculate critical constants and R functions to
    calculate adjusted P-values of the test statistics. In addition, the package also
    contains functions to evaluate testing powers and hence the necessary sample sizes
    specially for the classical problem of comparisons of several treatments with a
    control.
