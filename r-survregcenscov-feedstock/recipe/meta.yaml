  summary: The main function of this package allows estimation of a Weibull Regression for a
    right-censored endpoint, one interval-censored covariate, and an arbitrary number
    of non-censored covariates. Additional functions allow to switch between different
    parametrizations of Weibull regression used by different R functions, inference
    for the mean difference of two arbitrarily censored Normal samples, and estimation
    of canonical parameters from censored samples for several distributional assumptions.
