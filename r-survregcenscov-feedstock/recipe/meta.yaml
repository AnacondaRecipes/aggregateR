  summary: The function SurvRegCens() of this package allows estimation of a Weibull Regression
    for a right-censored endpoint, one interval-censored covariate, and an arbitrary
    number of non-censored covariates. Additional functions allow to switch between
    different parametrizations of Weibull regression used by different R functions,
    inference for the mean difference of two arbitrarily censored Normal samples, and
    estimation of canonical parameters from censored samples for several distributional
    assumptions. Hubeaux, S. and Rufibach, K. (2014) <arXiv:1402.0432>.
