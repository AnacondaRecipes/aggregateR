  summary: Estimation of time-dependent ROC curve and area under time dependent ROC curve (AUC)
    in the presence of censored data, with or without competing risks. Confidence intervals
    of AUCs and tests for comparing AUCs of two rival markers measured on the same subjects
    can be computed, using the iid-representation of the AUC estimator. Plot functions
    for time-dependent ROC curves and AUC curves are provided. Time-dependent Positive
    Predictive Values (PPV) and Negative Predictive Values (NPV) can also be computed.
    See Blanche et al. (2013) <doi:10.1002/sim.5958> and references therein for the
    details of the methods implemented in the package.
