  summary: Formulates a sparse distance weighted discrimination (SDWD) for high-dimensional classification
    and implements a very fast algorithm for computing its solution path with the L1,
    the elastic-net, and the adaptive elastic-net penalties. More details about the
    methodology SDWD is seen on Wang and Zou (2016) (<doi:10.1080/10618600.2015.1049700>).
