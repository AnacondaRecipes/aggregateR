  summary: Performs Gaussian process regression with heteroskedastic noise following the model
    by Binois, M., Gramacy, R., Ludkovski, M. (2016) <arXiv:1611.05902>, with implementation
    details in Binois, M. & Gramacy, R. B. (2021) <doi:10.18637/jss.v098.i13>. The input
    dependent noise is modeled as another Gaussian process. Replicated observations
    are encouraged as they yield computational savings. Sequential design procedures
    based on the integrated mean square prediction error and lookahead heuristics are
    provided, and notably fast update functions when adding new observations.
