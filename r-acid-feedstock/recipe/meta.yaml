  summary: Functions for the analysis of income distributions for subgroups of the population
    as defined by a set of variables like age, gender, region, etc. This entails a Kolmogorov-Smirnov
    test for a mixture distribution as well as functions for moments, inequality measures,
    entropy measures and polarisation measures of income distributions. This package
    thus aides the analysis of income inequality by offering tools for the exploratory
    analysis of income distributions at the disaggregated level.
