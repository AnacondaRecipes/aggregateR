  summary: ' Functions for vectorised conditional recoding of variables. case_when() enables
    you to vectorise multiple if and else statements (like ''CASE WHEN'' in ''SQL'').
    if_else() is a stricter and more predictable version of ifelse() in ''base'' that
    preserves attributes. These functions are  forked from ''dplyr'' with all package
    dependencies removed and behave identically to the originals.'
