  summary: Functions for vectorised conditional recoding of variables. case_when() enables you
    to vectorise multiple if and else statements (like 'CASE WHEN' in 'SQL'). if_else()
    is a stricter and more predictable version of ifelse() in 'base' that preserves
    attributes. These functions are forked from 'dplyr' with all package dependencies
    removed and behave identically to the originals.
