  summary: A complete analysis pipeline for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight
    (MALDI-TOF) and other two-dimensional mass spectrometry data. In addition to commonly
    used plotting and processing methods it includes distinctive features, namely baseline
    subtraction methods such as morphological filters (TopHat) or the statistics-sensitive
    non-linear iterative peak-clipping algorithm (SNIP), peak alignment using warping
    functions, handling of replicated measurements as well as allowing spectra with
    different resolutions.
