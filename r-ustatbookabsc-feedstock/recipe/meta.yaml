  summary: A set of functions leading to multivariate response L1 regression.  This includes
    functions on computing Euclidean inner products and norms,  weighted least squares
    estimates on multivariate responses, function to compute  fitted values and residuals.
    This package is a companion to the book "U-Statistics, M-estimation and Resampling",
    by Arup Bose and Snigdhansu Chatterjee, to appear  in 2017 as part of the "Texts
    and Readings in Mathematics" (TRIM) series of  Hindustan Book Agency and Springer-Verlag.
