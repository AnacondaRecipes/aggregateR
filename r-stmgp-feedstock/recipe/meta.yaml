  summary: Rapidly build accurate genetic prediction models for genome-wide association or whole-genome
    sequencing study data by smooth-threshold multivariate genetic prediction (STMGP)
    method. Variable selection is performed using marginal association test p-values
    with an optimal p-value cutoff selected by Cp-type criterion. Quantitative and binary
    traits are modeled respectively via linear and logistic regression models. A function
    that works through PLINK software (Purcell et al. 2007 <DOI:10.1086/519795>, Chang
    et al. 2015 <DOI:10.1186/s13742-015-0047-8>) <https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2>
