  summary: 'Provides a function to convert existing R functions into "errorized" versions  with
    added logging and handling functionality when encountering errors or warnings.  The
    errorize function accepts an existing R function as its first argument and  returns
    a R function with the exact same arguments and functionality. However,  if an error
    or warning occurs when running that "errorized" R function, it will save a  .Rds
    file to the current working directory with the relevant objects and information  required
    to immediately recreate the error.  '
