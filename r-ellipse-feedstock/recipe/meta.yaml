  summary: Contains various routines for drawing ellipses and ellipse-like confidence regions,
    implementing the plots described in Murdoch and Chow (1996), A graphical display
    of large correlation matrices, The American Statistician 50, 178-180. There are
    also routines implementing the profile plots described in Bates and Watts (1988),
    Nonlinear Regression Analysis and its Applications.
