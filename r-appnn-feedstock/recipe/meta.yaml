  summary: Amyloid propensity prediction neural network (APPNN) is an amyloidogenicity propensity
    predictor based on a machine learning approach through recursive feature selection
    and feed-forward neural networks, taking advantage of newly published sequences
    with experimental, in vitro, evidence of amyloid formation.
