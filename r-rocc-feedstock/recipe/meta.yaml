  summary: Functions for a classification method based on receiver operating characteristics
    (ROC). Briefly, features are selected according to their ranked AUC value in the
    training set. The selected features are merged by the mean value to form a metagene.
    The samples are ranked by their metagene value and the metagene threshold that has
    the highest accuracy in splitting the training samples is determined. A new sample
    is classified by its metagene value relative to the threshold. In the first place,
    the package is aimed at two class problems in gene expression data, but might also
    apply to other problems.
