  summary: Functions for a classification method based on receiver operating characteristics
    (ROC). Briefly, features are selected according to their ranked AUC value in the
    training set. The selected features are merged by the mean value to form a meta-gene.
    The samples are ranked by their meta-gene value and the meta-gene threshold that
    has the highest accuracy in splitting the training samples is determined. A new
    sample is classified by its meta-gene value relative to the threshold. In the first
    place, the package is aimed at two class problems in gene expression data, but might
    also apply to other problems.
