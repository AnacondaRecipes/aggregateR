  summary: A collection of common test and item analyses from a classical test theory (CTT) framework.
    Analyses can be applied to both dichotomous and polytomous data. Functions provide
    reliability analyses (alpha), item statistics, disctractor analyses, disattenuated
    correlations, scoring routines, and empirical ICCs.
