  summary: 'A tool to provide an easy, intuitive and consistent access to information contained
    in various R models, like model formulas, model terms, information about random
    effects, data that was used to fit the model or data from response variables. ''insight''
    mainly revolves around two types of functions: Functions that find (the names of)
    information, starting with ''find_'', and functions that get the underlying data,
    starting with ''get_''.  The package has a consistent syntax and works with many
    different model objects, where otherwise functions to access these information are
    missing.'
