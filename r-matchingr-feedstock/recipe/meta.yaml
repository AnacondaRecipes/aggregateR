  summary: Computes matching algorithms quickly using Rcpp. Implements the Gale-Shapley Algorithm
    to compute the stable matching for two-sided markets, such as the stable marriage
    problem and the college-admissions problem. Implements Irving's Algorithm for the
    stable roommate problem. Implements the top trading cycle algorithm for the indivisible
    goods trading problem.
