  summary: The TEQR package contains software to calculate the operating characteristics for
    the TEQR and the ACT designs.The TEQR (toxicity equivalence range) design is a toxicity
    based cumulative cohort design with added safety rules. The ACT (Activity constrained
    for toxicity) design  is also a cumulative cohort design with additional safety
    rules. The unique feature of this design is that dose is escalated based on lack
    of activity rather than on lack of toxicity and is de-escalated only if an unacceptable
    level of toxicity is experienced.
