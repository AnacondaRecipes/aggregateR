  summary: The number of clusters (k) is needed to start all the partitioning clustering algorithms.
    An optimal value of this input argument is widely determined by using some internal
    validity indices. Since most of the existing internal indices suggest a k value
    which is computed from the clustering results after several runs of a clustering
    algorithm they are computationally expensive. On the contrary,  the package 'kpeaks'
    enables to estimate k before running any clustering algorithm. It is based on a
    simple novel technique using the descriptive statistics of peak counts of the features
    in a data set.
