  summary: Given a likelihood provided by the user, this package applies it to a given matrix
    dataset in order to find change points in the data that maximize the sum of the
    likelihoods of all the segments. This package provides a handful of algorithms with
    different time complexities and assumption compromises so the user is able to choose
    the best one for the problem at hand. The implementation of the segmentation algorithms
    in this package are based on the paper by Bruno M. de Castro, Florencia Leonardi
    (2018) <arXiv:1501.01756>. The Berlin weather sample dataset was provided by Deutscher
    Wetterdienst <https://dwd.de/>. You can find all the references in the Acknowledgments
