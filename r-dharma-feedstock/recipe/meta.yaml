  summary: The 'DHARMa' package uses a simulation-based approach to create readily interpretable
    scaled (quantile) residuals for fitted (generalized) linear mixed models. Currently
    supported are linear and generalized linear (mixed) models from 'lme4' (classes
    'lmerMod', 'glmerMod'), 'glmmTMB' 'GLMMadaptive' and 'spaMM', generalized additive
    models ('gam' from 'mgcv'), 'glm' (including 'negbin' from 'MASS', but excluding
    quasi-distributions) and 'lm' model classes. Moreover, externally created simulations,
    e.g. posterior predictive simulations from Bayesian software such as 'JAGS', 'STAN',
    or 'BUGS' can be processed as well. The resulting residuals are standardized to
    values between 0 and 1 and can be interpreted as intuitively as residuals from a
    linear regression. The package also provides a number of plot and test functions
    for typical model misspecification problems, such as over/underdispersion, zero-inflation,
    and residual spatial and temporal autocorrelation.
