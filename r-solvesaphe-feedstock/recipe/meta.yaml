  summary: Universal and robust algorithm for solving the total alkalinity-pH equation presented
    in G. Munhoven (2013) <doi:10.5194/gmd-6-1367-2013> and G. Munhoven (2021) <doi:10.5194/gmd-2020-447>.
    The total alkalinity-pH equation relates total alkalinity and pH for a given set
    of acid-base concentrations in a given water sample, among which carbonic acid.
    This package is particularly useful in marine chemistry involving dissolved inorganic
    carbon. Original package in Fortran can be found at <doi:10.5281/zenodo.4328965>.
