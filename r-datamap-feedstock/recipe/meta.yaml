  summary: datamap utilizes variable bindings and objects of class "UserDefinedDatabase" to provide
    a simple mapping system to foreign objects. Maps can be used as environments or
    attached to the search path, and changes to either are persistent. Mapped foreign
    objects are fetched in real-time and are never cached by the mapping system.
