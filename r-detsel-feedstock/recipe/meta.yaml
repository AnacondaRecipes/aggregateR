  summary: 'In the new era of population genomics, surveys of genetic polymorphism ("genome scans")
    offer the opportunity to distinguish locus-specific from genome wide effects at
    many loci. Identifying presumably neutral regions of the genome that are assumed
    to be influenced by genome-wide effects only, and excluding presumably selected
    regions, is therefore critical to infer population demography and phylogenetic history
    reliably. Conversely, detecting locus-specific effects may help identify those genes
    that have been, or still are, targeted by natural selection. The software package
    DetSel has been developed to identify markers that show deviation from neutral expectation
    in pairwise comparisons of diverging populations. '
