  summary: Fast, optimal, and reproducible weighted univariate clustering by dynamic programming.
    Four problems are solved, including univariate k-means (Wang & Song 2011) <doi:10.32614/RJ-2011-015>
    (Song & Zhong 2020) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa613>, k-median, k-segments,
    and multi-channel weighted k-means. Dynamic programming is used to minimize the
    sum of (weighted) within-cluster distances using respective metrics. Its advantage
    over heuristic clustering in efficiency and accuracy is pronounced at a large number
    of clusters. Multi-channel weighted k-means groups multiple univariate signals into
    k clusters. An auxiliary function generates histograms adaptive to patterns in data.
    This package provides a powerful set of tools for univariate data analysis with
    guaranteed optimality, efficiency, and reproducibility, useful for peak calling
    on temporal, spatial, and spectral data.
