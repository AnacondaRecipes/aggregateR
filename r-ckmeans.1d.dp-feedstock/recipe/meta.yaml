  summary: Fast optimal univariate clustering and segementation by dynamic programming. Three
    types of problem including univariate k-means, k-median, and k-segments are solved
    with guaranteed optimality and reproducibility. The core algorithm minimizes the
    sum of within-cluster distances using respective metrics. Its advantage over heuristic
    clustering algorithms in efficiency and accuracy is increasingly pronounced as the
    number of clusters k increases. Weighted k-means and unweighted k-segments algorithms
    can also optimally segment time series and perform peak calling. An auxiliary function
    generates histograms that are adaptive to patterns in data. In contrast to heuristic
    methods, this package provides a powerful set of tools for univariate data analysis
    with guaranteed optimality. Use four spaces when indenting paragraphs within the
    Description.
