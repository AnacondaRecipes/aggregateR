  summary: R interface to CPLEX solvers for linear, quadratic, and (linear and quadratic) mixed
    integer programs. Support for quadratically constrained programming is available.
    See the file "INSTALL" for details on how to install the Rcplex package in Linux/Unix-like
    and Windows systems. Support for sparse matrices is provided by an S3-style class
    "simple_triplet_matrix" from package slam and by objects from the Matrix package
    class hierarchy.
