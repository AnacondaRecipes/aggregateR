  summary: 'The Behavioral Change Point Analysis (BCPA) is a method of identifying hidden shifts
    in the underlying parameters of a time series, developed specifically to be applied
    to animal movement data which is irregularly sampled.  The method is based on: E.
    Gurarie, R. Andrews and K. Laidre A novel method for identifying behavioural changes
    in animal movement data (2009) Ecology Letters 12:5 395-408. A development version
    is on <https://github.com/EliGurarie/bcpa>. NOTE: the BCPA method may be useful
    for any univariate, irregularly sampled Gaussian time-series, but animal movement
    analysts are encouraged to apply correlated velocity change point analysis as implemented
    in the smoove package, as of this writing on GitHub at <https://github.com/EliGurarie/smoove>.
    An example of a univariate analysis is provided in the UnivariateBCPA vignette.'
