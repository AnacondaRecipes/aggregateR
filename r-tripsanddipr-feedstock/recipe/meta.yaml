  summary: Uses read counts for biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to compare the
    likelihoods for the observed read counts given that a sample is either diploid or
    triploid. It allows parameters to be specified to account for sequencing error rates
    and allelic bias. For details of the algorithm, please see Delomas (2019) <doi:10.1111/1755-0998.13073>.
