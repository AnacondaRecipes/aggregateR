  summary: N>=3 methods are used to measure each of n items.  The data are used to estimate simultaneously
    systematic error (bias) and random error (imprecision). Observed measurements for
    each method or device are assumed to be linear functions of the unknown true values
    and the errors are assumed normally distributed. Maximum likelihood  estimation
    is used for the imprecision standard deviation estimates.  Pairwise calibration
    curves and plots can be easily generated.
