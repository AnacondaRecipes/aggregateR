  summary: N>=3 methods are used to measure each of n items. The data are used to estimate simultaneously
    systematic error (bias) and random error (imprecision). Observed measurements for
    each method or device are assumed to be linear functions of the unknown true values
    and the errors are assumed normally distributed. Pairwise calibration curves and
    plots can be easily generated. Unlike the 'ncb.od' function, the 'omx' function
    builds a one-factor measurement error model using 'OpenMx' and allows missing values,
    uses full information maximum likelihood to estimate parameters, and provides both
    likelihood-based and bootstrapped confidence intervals for all parameters, in addition
    to Wald-type intervals.
