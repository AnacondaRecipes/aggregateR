  summary: Broadly useful convenient and efficient R functions that bring users concise and elegant
    R data analyses. This package includes easy-to-use functions for (1) basic R programming
    (e.g., set working directory to the path of currently opened file; import/export
    data from/to files in any format; print tables to Microsoft Word); (2) multivariate
    computation (e.g., compute scale sums/means/... with reverse scoring); (3) reliability
    analyses and factor analyses; (4) descriptive statistics and correlation analyses;
    (5) t-test, multi-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA), simple-effect analysis, and
    post-hoc multiple comparison; (6) tidy report of statistical models (to R Console
    and Microsoft Word); (7) mediation and moderation analyses (PROCESS); and (8) additional
    toolbox for statistics and graphics.
