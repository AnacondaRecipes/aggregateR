  summary: Selection of informative features like genes, transcripts, RNA seq, etc. using Bootstrap
    Maximum Relevance and Minimum Redundancy technique from a given high dimensional
    genomic dataset. Informative gene selection involves identification of relevant
    genes and removal of redundant genes as much as possible from a large gene space.
    Main applications in high-dimensional expression data analysis (e.g. microarray
    data, NGS expression data and other genomics and proteomics applications).
