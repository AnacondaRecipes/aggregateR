  summary: Interpreted interface between GRASS 6+ geographical  information system and R, based
    on starting R from within the GRASS  environment, or running free-standing R in
    a temporary GRASS location; the package provides facilities for using all GRASS
    commands from the  R command line. This package may not be used for GRASS 7, for
    which rgrass7 should be used.
