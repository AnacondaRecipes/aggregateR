  summary: Classification is based on the recently developed phylogenetic approach by Assis and
    Bachtrog (2013). The method classifies the evolutionary mechanisms retaining pairs
    of duplicate genes (conservation, neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization, or
    specialization) by comparing gene expression profiles of duplicate genes in one
    species to those of their single- copy ancestral genes in a sister species.
