  summary: Creates empty plots with compact axis notation to which users can add whatever they
    like (points, lines, text, etc.) The notation is more compact in the sense that
    the axis-labels and tick-labels are closer to the axis and the tick-marks are shorter.
    Also, if the plot appears as part of a matrix, the x-axis notation is suppressed
    unless the plot appears along the bottom row and the y-axis notation is suppress
    unless the plot appears along the left column.
