  summary: Functions for reading, analysing and plotting river networks. For this package, river
    networks consist of sections and nodes with associated attributes, e.g. to characterise
    their morphological, chemical and biological state. The package provides functions
    to read this data from text files, to analyse the network structure and network
    paths and regions consisting of sections and nodes that fulfill prescribed criteria,
    and to plot the river network and associated properties.
