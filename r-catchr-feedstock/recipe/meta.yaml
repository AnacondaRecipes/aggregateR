  license: MIT
  summary: R has a unique way of dealing with warnings, errors, messages,  and other conditions,
    but it can often be troublesome to users coming  from different programming backgrounds.
    The purpose of this package is  to provide flexible and useful tools for handling
    R conditions with  less hassle. In order to lower the barrier of entry, keep code
    clean  and readable, and reduce the amount of typing required, `catchr` uses  a
    very simple domain-specific language that simplifies things on the  front-end.  This
    package aims to maintain a continuous learning curve that lets new  users jump straight
    in to condition-handling, while simultaneously  offering depth and complexity for
    more advanced users.
