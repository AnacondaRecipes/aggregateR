  summary: Methods for calculating and testing the significance of pairwise monotonic association
    from and based on the work of Pimentel (2009) <doi:10.4135/9781412985291.n2>. Computation
    of association of vectors from one or multiple sets can be performed in parallel
    thanks to the packages 'foreach' and 'doMC'.
