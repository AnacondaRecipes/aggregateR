  summary: Provides a function that quickly computes the fine structure isotope patterns of a
    set of chemical formulas to a given degree of accuracy (up to the limit set by errors
    in floating point arithmetic). A data-set comprising the masses and isotopic abundances
    of individual elements is also provided and calculation of isotopic gross structures
    is also supported.
