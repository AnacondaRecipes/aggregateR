  summary: While autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models allow for extremely flexible dynamics,
    interpreting substantive significance of complex lag structures remains difficult.
    This package is designed to assist users in dynamically simulating and plotting
    the results of various ARDL models. It also contains post-estimation diagnostics,
    including a test for cointegration when estimating the error-correction variant
    of the autoregressive distributed lag model (Pesaran, Shin, and Smith 2001 <doi:10.1002/jae.616>).
