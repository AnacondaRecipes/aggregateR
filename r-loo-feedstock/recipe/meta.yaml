  summary: Efficient approximate leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) for Bayesian models fit
    using Markov chain Monte Carlo. The approximation uses Pareto smoothed importance
    sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. As a byproduct
    of the calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive
    errors and for the comparison of predictive errors between models. The package also  provides
    methods for using stacking and other model weighting techniques  to average Bayesian
    predictive distributions.
