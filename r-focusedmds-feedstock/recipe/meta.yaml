  summary: Takes a distance matrix and plots it as an interactive graph. One point is focused
    at the center of the graph, around which all other points are plotted in their exact
    distances as given in the distance matrix. All other non-focus points are plotted
    as best as possible in relation to one another. Double click on any point to choose
    a new focus point, and hover over points to see their ID labels. If color label
    categories are given, hover over colors in the legend to highlight only those points
    and click on colors to highlight multiple groups. For more information on the rationale
    and mathematical background, as well as an interactive introduction, see <https://lea-urpa.github.io/focusedMDS.html>.
