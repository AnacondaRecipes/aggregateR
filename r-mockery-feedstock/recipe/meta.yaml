  summary: The two main functionalities of this package are creating mock objects (functions)
    and selectively intercepting calls to a given function that originate in some other
    function. It can be used with any testing framework available for R. Mock objects
    can be injected with either this package's own stub() function or a similar with_mock()
    facility present in the 'testthat' package.
