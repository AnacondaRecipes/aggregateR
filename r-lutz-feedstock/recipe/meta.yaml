  summary: 'Input latitude and longitude values or an ''sf/sfc'' POINT object and get back the
    time zone in which they exist. Two methods are implemented. One is very fast and
    uses ''Rcpp'' in conjunction with data from the ''Javascript'' library (<https://github.com/darkskyapp/tz-lookup-oss/>).
    This method also works outside of countries'' borders and in international waters,
    however speed comes at the cost of accuracy - near time zone borders away from populated
    centres there is a chance that it will return the incorrect time zone. The other
    method is slower but more accurate - it uses the ''sf'' package to intersect points
    with a detailed map of time zones from here: <https://github.com/evansiroky/timezone-boundary-builder/>.
    The package also contains several utility functions for helping to understand and
    visualize time zones, such as listing of world time zones, including information
    about daylight savings times and their offsets from UTC. You can also plot a time
    zone to visualize the UTC offset over a year and when daylight savings times are
    in effect.'
