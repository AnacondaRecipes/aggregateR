  summary: 'Numerical Formal Concept Analysis (nFCA) is a modern unsupervised learning tool for
    analyzing general numerical data. Given input data, this R package nFCA outputs
    two nFCA graphs: a H-graph and an I-graph that reveal systematic, hierarchical clustering
    and inherent structure of the data.'
