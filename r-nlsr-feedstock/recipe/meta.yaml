  summary: Provides tools for working with nonlinear least squares problems. For the estimation
    of models reliable and robust tools than nls(), where the the Gauss-Newton method
    frequently stops with 'singular gradient' messages. This is accomplished by using,
    where possible, analytic derivatives to compute the matrix of derivatives and a
    stabilization of the solution of the estimation equations. Tools for approximate
    or externally supplied derivative matrices are included. Bounds and masks on parameters
    are handled properly.
