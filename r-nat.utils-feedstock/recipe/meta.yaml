  summary: Utility functions that may be of general interest but are specifically required by
    the 'NeuroAnatomy Toolbox' ('nat'). Includes functions to provide a basic make style
    system to update files based on timestamp information, file locking and 'touch'
    utility. Convenience functions for working with file paths include 'abs2rel', 'split_path'
    and 'common_path'. Finally there are utility functions for working with 'zip' and
    'gzip' files including integrity tests.
