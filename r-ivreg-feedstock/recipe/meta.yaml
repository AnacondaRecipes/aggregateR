  summary: Instrumental variable estimation for linear models by two-stage least-squares (2SLS)
    regression or by robust-regression via M-estimation (2SM) or MM-estimation (2SMM).
    The main ivreg() model-fitting function is designed to provide a workflow as similar
    as possible to standard lm() regression. A wide range of methods is provided for
    fitted ivreg model objects, including extensive functionality for computing and
    graphing regression diagnostics in addition to other standard model tools.
