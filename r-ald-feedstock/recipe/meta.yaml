  summary: 'It provides the density, distribution function, quantile function,  random number
    generator, likelihood function, moments and Maximum Likelihood estimators for a
    given sample, all this for the three parameter Asymmetric Laplace Distribution defined  in
    Koenker and Machado (1999). This is a special case of the skewed family of distributions
    available in Galarza et.al. (2017) <doi:10.1002/sta4.140> useful for quantile regression. '
