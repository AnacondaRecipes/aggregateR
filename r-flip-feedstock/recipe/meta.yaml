  summary: 'It implements many univariate and multivariate permutation (and rotation) tests.
    Allowed tests: the t one and two samples, ANOVA, linear models, Chi Squared test,
    rank tests (i.e. Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis), Sign test and Mc Nemar.
    Test on Linear Models are performed also in presence of covariates (i.e. nuisance
    parameters). The permutation and the rotation methods to get the null distribution
    of the test statistics are available. It also implements methods for multiplicity
    control such as Westfall & Young minP procedure and Closed Testing (Marcus, 1976)
    and k-FWER. Moreover, it allows to test for fixed effects in mixed effects models.'
