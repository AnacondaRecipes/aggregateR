  summary: "Functions for evaluating and visualizing predictive model performance (specifically:
    binary classifiers) in the field of customer scoring. These metrics include lift,
    lift index, gain percentage, top-decile lift, F1-score, expected misclassification
    cost and absolute misclassification cost. See Berry & Linoff (2004, ISBN:0-471-47064-3),
    Witten and Frank (2005, 0-12-088407-0) and Blattberg, Kim & Neslin (2008, ISBN:978\u20130\u2013387\u201372578\u20139)
    for details. Visualization functions are included for lift charts and gain percentage
    charts. All metrics that require class predictions offer the possibility to dynamically
    determine cutoff values for transforming real-valued probability predictions into
    class predictions."
