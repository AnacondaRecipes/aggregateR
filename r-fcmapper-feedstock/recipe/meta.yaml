  summary: Provides several functions to create and manipulate fuzzy cognitive maps. It is based
    on 'FCMapper' for Excel, distributed at <http:// www.fcmappers.net/joomla/>, developed
    by Michael Bachhofer and Martin Wildenberg. Maps are inputted as adjacency matrices.
    Attributes of the maps and the equilibrium values of the concepts (including with
    user-defined constrained values) can be calculated. The maps can be graphed with
    a function that calls 'igraph'. Multiple maps with shared concepts can be aggregated.
