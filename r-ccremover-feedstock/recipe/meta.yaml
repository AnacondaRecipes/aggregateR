  summary: Implements a method for identifying and removing the cell-cycle effect from scRNA-Seq
    data. The description of the method is in Barron M. and Li J. (2016) <doi:10.1038/srep33892>.
    Identifying and removing the cell-cycle effect from single-cell RNA-Sequencing data.
    Submitted. Different from previous methods, ccRemover implements a mechanism that
    formally tests whether a component is cell-cycle related or not, and thus while
    it often thoroughly removes the cell-cycle effect, it preserves other features/signals
    of interest in the data.
