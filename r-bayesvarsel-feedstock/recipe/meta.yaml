  summary: 'Conceived to calculate Bayes factors in Linear models and then to provide a formal
    Bayesian answer to testing and variable selection problems. From a theoretical side,
    the emphasis in this package is placed on the prior distributions and it allows
    a wide range of them: Jeffreys (1961); Zellner and Siow(1980)<DOI:10.1007/bf02888369>;
    Zellner and Siow(1984); Zellner (1986)<DOI:10.2307/2233941>; Fernandez et al. (2001)<DOI:10.1016/s0304-4076(00)00076-2>;
    Liang et al. (2008)<DOI:10.1198/016214507000001337>  and Bayarri et al. (2012)<DOI:10.1214/12-aos1013>.
    The interaction with the package is through a friendly interface that syntactically
    mimics the well-known lm() command of R. The resulting objects can be easily explored
    providing the user very valuable information (like marginal, joint and conditional
    inclusion probabilities of potential variables; the highest posterior probability
    model, HPM; the median probability model, MPM) about the structure of the true -data
    generating- model. Additionally, this package incorporates abilities to handle problems
    with a large number of potential explanatory variables through parallel and heuristic
    versions of the main commands, Garcia-Donato and Martinez-Beneito (2013)<DOI:10.1080/01621459.2012.742443>.
    It also allows problems with p>n and p>>n and also incorporates routines to handle
    problems with variable selection with factors.'
