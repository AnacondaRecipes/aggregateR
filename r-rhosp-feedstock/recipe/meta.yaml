  summary: Evaluating risk (that a patient arises a side effect) during hospitalization is the
    main purpose of this package. Several methods (Parametric, non parametric and De
    Vielder estimation) to estimate the risk constant (R) are implemented in this package.
    There are also functions to simulate the different models of this issue in order
    to quantify the previous estimators. It is necessary to read at least the first
    six pages of the report to understand the topic.
