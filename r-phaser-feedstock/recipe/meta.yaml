  summary: Performs a qualitative analysis of one- and two-dimensional autonomous ordinary differential
    equation systems, using phase plane methods. Programs are available to identify
    and classify equilibrium points, plot the direction field, and plot trajectories
    for multiple initial conditions. In the one-dimensional case, a program is also
    available to plot the phase portrait. Whilst in the two-dimensional case, programs
    are additionally available to plot nullclines and stable/unstable manifolds of saddle
    points. Many example systems are provided for the user. For further details can
    be found in Grayling (2014) <doi:10.32614/RJ-2014-023>.
