  summary: 'Estimation of the sample univariate, cross and return time extremograms. The package
    can also adds empirical confidence bands to each of the extremogram plots via a
    permutation procedure under the assumption that the data are independent. Finally,
    the stationary bootstrap allows us to construct credible confidence bands for the
    extremograms.  '
