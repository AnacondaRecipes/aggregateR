  summary: Provides methods for sensory discrimination methods; duotrio, tetrad, triangle, 2-AFC,
    3-AFC, A-not A, same-different, 2-AC and degree-of-difference. This enables the
    calculation of d-primes, standard errors of d-primes, sample size and power computations,
    and comparisons of different d-primes. Methods for profile likelihood confidence
    intervals and plotting are included.
