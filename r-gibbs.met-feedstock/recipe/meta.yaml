  summary: This package provides two generic functions for performing Markov chain sampling in
    a naive way for a user-defined target distribution, which involves only continuous
    variables. The function "gibbs_met" performs Gibbs sampling with each 1-dimensional
    distribution sampled with Metropolis update using Gaussian proposal distribution
    centered at the previous state. The function "met_gaussian" updates the whole state
    with Metropolis method using independent Gaussian proposal distribution centered
    at the previous state. The sampling is carried out without considering any special
    tricks for improving efficiency. This package is aimed at only routine applications
    of MCMC in moderate-dimensional problems.
