  summary: Provides a set of tools for estimating hierarchical linear models and effect sizes
    based on data from single-case designs.  Functions are provided for calculating
    standardized mean difference effect sizes that  are directly comparable to standardized
    mean differences estimated from between-subjects randomized experiments, as described
    in Hedges, Pustejovsky, and Shadish (2012) <DOI:10.1002/jrsm.1052>;  Hedges, Pustejovsky,
    and Shadish (2013) <DOI:10.1002/jrsm.1086>; and  Pustejovsky, Hedges, and Shadish
    (2014) <DOI:10.3102/1076998614547577>.  Includes an interactive web interface.
