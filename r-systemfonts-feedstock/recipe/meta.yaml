  summary: Provides system native access to the font catalogue. As font handling varies between
    systems it is difficult to correctly locate installed fonts across different operating
    systems. The 'systemfonts' package provides bindings to the native libraries on
    Windows, macOS and Linux for finding font files that can then be used further by
    e.g. graphic devices. The main use is intended to be from compiled code but 'systemfonts'
    also provides access from R.
