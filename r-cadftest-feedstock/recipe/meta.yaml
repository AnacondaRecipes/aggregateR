  summary: Hansen's (1995) Covariate-Augmented Dickey-Fuller (CADF) test. The only required argument
    is y, the Tx1 time series to be tested. If no stationary covariate X is passed to
    the procedure, then an ordinary ADF test is performed. The p-values of the test
    are computed using the procedure illustrated in Lupi (2009).
