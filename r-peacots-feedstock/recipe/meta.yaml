  summary: Calculates the periodogram of a time series, maximum-likelihood fits an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
    state space (OUSS) null model and evaluates the statistical significance of periodogram
    peaks against the OUSS null hypothesis. The OUSS is a parsimonious model for stochastically
    fluctuating variables with linear stabilizing forces, subject to uncorrelated measurement
    errors. Contrary to the classical white noise null model for detecting cyclicity,
    the OUSS model can account for temporal correlations typically occurring in ecological
    and geological time series.
