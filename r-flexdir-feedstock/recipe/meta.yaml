  summary: Provides tools to work with the Flexible Dirichlet distribution. The main features
    are an E-M algorithm for computing the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter
    vector and a function based on conditional bootstrap to estimate its asymptotic
    variance-covariance matrix. It contains also functions to plot graphs, to generate
    random observations and to handle compositional data.
