  summary: Catalogues of resolution IV regular fractional factorial designs in 128 runs are provided
    for up to 33 2-level factors. The catalogues are complete, excluding resolution
    IV designs without 5-letter words, because these do not add value for a search for
    unblocked clear designs. The previous package version 1.0 with complete catalogues
    up to 24 runs (24 runs and a namespace added later) can be downloaded from the authors
    website.
