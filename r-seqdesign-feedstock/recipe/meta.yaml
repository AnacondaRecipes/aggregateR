  summary: A modification of the preventive vaccine efficacy trial design of Gilbert, Grove et
    al. (2011, Statistical Communications in Infectious Diseases) is implemented, with
    application generally to individual-randomized clinical trials with multiple active
    treatment groups and a shared control group, and a study endpoint that is a time-to-event
    endpoint subject to right-censoring. The design accounts for the issues that the
    efficacy of the treatment/vaccine groups may take time to accrue while the multiple
    treatment administrations/vaccinations are given; there is interest in assessing
    the durability of treatment efficacy over time; and group sequential monitoring
    of each treatment group for potential harm, non-efficacy/efficacy futility, and
    high efficacy is warranted. The design divides the trial into two stages of time
    periods, where each treatment is first evaluated for efficacy in the first stage
    of follow-up, and, if and only if it shows significant treatment efficacy in stage
    one, it is evaluated for longer-term durability of efficacy in stage two. The package
    produces plots and tables describing operating characteristics of a specified design
    including an unconditional power for intention-to-treat and per-protocol/as-treated
    analyses; trial duration; probabilities of the different possible trial monitoring
    outcomes (e.g., stopping early for non-efficacy); unconditional power for comparing
    treatment efficacies; and distributions of numbers of endpoint events occurring
    after the treatments/vaccinations are given, useful as input parameters for the
    design of studies of the association of biomarkers with a clinical outcome (surrogate
    endpoint problem). The code can be used for a single active treatment versus control
    design and for a single-stage design.
