  summary: 'Implementation of Nelson rules for control charts in ''R''. The ''Rspc'' implements
    some Statistical Process Control methods, namely Levey-Jennings type of I (individuals)
    chart, Shewhart C (count) chart and Nelson rules (as described in Montgomery, D.
    C. (2013) Introduction to statistical quality control. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.). Typical
    workflow is taking the time series, specify the control limits, and list of Nelson
    rules you want to evaluate. There are several options how to modify the rules (one
    sided limits, numerical parameters of rules, etc.). Package is also capable of calculating
    the control limits from the data (so far only for i-chart and c-chart are implemented).'
