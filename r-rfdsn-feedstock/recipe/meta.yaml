  summary: This package facilitates searching for and downloading seismic time series in miniSEED
    format (a minimalist version of the Standard for the Exchange of Earthquake Data)
    from International Federation of Digital Seismograph Networks repositories. This
    package can also be used to gather information about seismic networks (stations,
    channels, locations, etc) and find historical earthquake data (origins, magnitudes,
    etc).
