  summary: 'C++ classes to embed R in C++ applications A C++ class providing the R interpreter
    is offered by this package making it easier to have "R inside" your C++ application.
    As R itself is embedded into your application, a shared library build of R is required.
    This works on Linux, OS X and even on Windows provided you use the same tools used
    to build R itself. d Numerous examples are provided in the eight subdirectories
    of the examples/ directory of the installed package: standard, ''mpi'' (for parallel
    computing), ''qt'' (showing how to embed ''RInside'' inside a Qt GUI application),
    ''wt'' (showing how to build a "web-application" using the Wt toolkit), ''armadillo''
    (for ''RInside'' use with ''RcppArmadillo'') and ''eigen'' (for ''RInside'' use
    with ''RcppEigen'').  The examples use ''GNUmakefile(s)'' with GNU extensions, so
    a GNU make is required (and will use the ''GNUmakefile'' automatically). ''Doxygen''-generated
    documentation of the C++ classes is available at the ''RInside'' website as well.'
