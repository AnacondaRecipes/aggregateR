  summary: Allows access to data in running instance of Microsoft Excel (e. g. 'xl[a1] = xl[b2]*3'
    and so on). Graphics can be transferred with 'xl[a1] = current.graphics()'. Additionally
    there are function for reading/writing 'Excel' files - 'xl.read.file'/'xl.save.file'.
    They are not fast but able to read/write '*.xlsb'-files and password-protected files.
    There is an Excel workbook with examples of calling R from Excel in the 'doc' folder.
    It tries to keep things as simple as possible - there are no needs in any additional
    installations besides R, only 'VBA' code in the Excel workbook. Microsoft Excel
    is required for this package.
