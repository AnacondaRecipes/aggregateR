  summary: An interface to the 'mclust' package to easily carry out latent profile analysis ("LPA").
    Provides functionality to estimate commonly-specified models. Follows a tidy approach,
    in that output is in the form of a data frame that can subsequently be computed
    on. Also has functions to interface to the commercial 'MPlus' software via the 'MplusAutomation'
    package.
