  summary: Sampling from the Cholesky factorization of a Wishart random variable, sampling from
    the inverse Wishart distribution, sampling from the Cholesky factorization of an
    inverse Wishart random variable, sampling from the pseudo Wishart distribution,
    sampling from the generalized inverse Wishart distribution, computing densities
    for the Wishart and inverse Wishart distributions, and computing the multivariate
    gamma and digamma functions. Provides a header file so the C functions can be called
    directly from other programs.
