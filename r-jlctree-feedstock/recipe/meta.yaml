  summary: Implements the tree-based approach to joint modeling of time-to-event and longitudinal
    data. This approach looks for a tree-based partitioning such that within each estimated
    latent class defined by a terminal node, the time-to-event and longitudinal responses
    display a lack of association. See Zhang and Simonoff (2018) <arXiv:1812.01774>.
