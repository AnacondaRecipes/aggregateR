  summary: Functions to allow users to build and analyze design consistent tree and random forest
    models using survey data from a complex sample design.  The tree model algorithm
    can fit a linear model to survey data in each node obtained by recursively partitioning
    the data.  The splitting variables and selected splits are obtained using a randomized
    permutation test procedure which adjusted for complex sample design features used
    to obtain the data. Likewise the model fitting algorithm produces design-consistent
    coefficients to any specified least squares linear model between the dependent and
    independent variables used in the end nodes. The main functions return the resulting
    binary tree or random forest as an object of "rpms" or "rpms_forest" type. The package
    also provides methods modeling a "boosted" tree or forest model and a tree model
    for zero-inflated data as well as a number of functions and methods available for
    use with these object types.
