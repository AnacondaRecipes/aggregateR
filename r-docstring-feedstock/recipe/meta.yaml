  summary: Provides the ability to display something analogous to Python's docstrings within
    R.  By allowing the user to document their functions as comments at the beginning
    of their function without requiring putting the function into a package we allow
    more users to easily provide documentation for their functions. The documentation
    can be viewed just like any other help files for functions provided by packages
    as well.
