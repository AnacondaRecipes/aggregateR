  summary: A set of functions is provided for 1) the stratum lengths analysis along a chosen
    direction, 2) fast estimation of continuous lag spatial Markov chains model parameters
    and probability computing (also for large data sets), 3) transition probability
    maps and transiograms drawing, 4) simulation methods for categorical random fields.
