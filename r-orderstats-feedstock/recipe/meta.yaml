  summary: All the methods in this package generate a vector of uniform order statistics using
    a beta distribution and use an inverse cumulative distribution function for some
    distribution to give a vector of random order statistic variables for some distribution.
    This is much more efficient than using a loop since it is directly sampling from
    the order statistic distribution.
