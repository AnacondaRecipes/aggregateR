  summary: Provides two Bayesian models for detecting the association between rare genetic variants
    and a trait that can be continuous, ordinal or binary. Bayesian latent variable
    collapsing model (BLVCM) detects interaction effect and is dedicated to twin design
    while it can also be applied to independent samples. Hierarchical Bayesian multiple
    regression model (HBMR) incorporates genotype uncertainty information and can be
    applied to either independent or family samples. Furthermore, it deals with continuous,
    binary and ordinal traits.
