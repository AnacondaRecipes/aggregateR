  summary: Derives prediction rule ensembles (PREs). Largely follows the procedure for deriving
    PREs as described in Friedman & Popescu (2008; <DOI:10.1214/07-AOAS148>), with adjustments
    and improvements. The main function pre() derives prediction rule ensembles consisting
    of rules and/or linear terms for continuous, binary, count, multinomial, and multivariate
    continuous responses. Function gpe() derives generalized prediction ensembles, consisting
    of rules, hinge and linear functions of the predictor variables.
