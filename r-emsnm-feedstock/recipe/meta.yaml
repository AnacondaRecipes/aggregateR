  summary: It provides a method based on EM algorithm to estimate the parameter of a mixture
    model, Sigmoid-Normal Model, where the samples come from several normal distributions
    (also call them subgroups) whose mean is determined by co-variable Z and coefficient
    alpha while the variance are homogeneous. Meanwhile, the subgroup each item belongs
    to is determined by co-variables X and coefficient eta through Sigmoid link function
    which is the extension of Logistic Link function. It uses bootstrap to estimate
    the standard error of parameters. When sample is indeed separable, removing estimation
    with abnormal sigma, the estimation of alpha is quite well. I used this method to
    explore the subgroup structure of HIV patients and it can be used in other domains
    where exists subgroup structure.
