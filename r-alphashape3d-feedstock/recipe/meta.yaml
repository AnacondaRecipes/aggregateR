  summary: Implementation in R of the alpha-shape of a finite set of points in the three-dimensional
    space. The alpha-shape generalizes the convex hull and allows to recover the shape
    of non-convex and even non-connected sets in 3D, given a random sample of points
    taken into it. Besides the computation of the alpha-shape, this package provides
    users with functions to compute the volume of the alpha-shape, identify the connected
    components and facilitate the three-dimensional graphical visualization of the estimated
    set.
