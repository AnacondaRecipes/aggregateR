  summary: Provides several cluster-robust variance estimators (i.e., sandwich estimators) for
    ordinary and weighted least squares linear regression models, including the bias-reduced
    linearization estimator introduced by Bell and McCaffrey (2002) <https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/12-001-x/2002002/article/9058-eng.pdf>
    and developed further by Pustejovsky and Tipton (2017) <DOI:10.1080/07350015.2016.1247004>.
    The package includes functions for estimating the variance- covariance matrix and
    for testing single- and multiple- contrast hypotheses based on Wald test statistics.
    Tests of single regression coefficients use Satterthwaite or saddle-point corrections.
    Tests of multiple- contrast hypotheses use an approximation to Hotelling's T-squared
    distribution. Methods are provided for a variety of fitted models, including lm()
    and mlm objects, glm(), ivreg() (from package 'AER'), plm() (from package 'plm'),
    gls() and lme() (from 'nlme'), lmer() (from `lme4`), robu() (from 'robumeta'), and
    rma.uni() and rma.mv() (from 'metafor').
