  summary: Provides several cluster-robust variance estimators (i.e., sandwich estimators) for
    ordinary and weighted least squares linear regression models, including the bias-reduced
    linearization estimator introduced by Bell and McCaffrey (2002) <https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/12-001-x/2002002/article/9058-eng.pdf>
    and developed further by Pustejovsky and Tipton (2017) <DOI:10.1080/07350015.2016.1247004>.
    The package includes functions for estimating the variance- covariance matrix and
    for testing single- and multiple- contrast hypotheses based on Wald test statistics.
    Tests of single regression coefficients use Satterthwaite or saddle-point corrections.
    Tests of multiple- contrast hypotheses use an approximation to Hotelling's T-squared
    distribution. Methods are provided for a variety of fitted models, including lm()
    and mlm objects, glm(), geeglm() (from package 'geepack'), ivreg() (from package
    'AER'), ivreg() (from package 'ivreg' when estimated by ordinary least squares),
    plm() (from package 'plm'), gls() and lme() (from 'nlme'), lmer() (from `lme4`),
    robu() (from 'robumeta'), and rma.uni() and rma.mv() (from 'metafor').
