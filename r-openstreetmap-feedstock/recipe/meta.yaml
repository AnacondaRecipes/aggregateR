  summary: Accesses high resolution raster maps using the OpenStreetMap protocol. Dozens of road,
    satellite, and topographic map servers are directly supported, including Apple,
    Mapnik, Bing, and stamen. Additionally raster maps may be constructed using custom
    tile servers.  Maps can be plotted using either base graphics, or ggplot2. This
    package is not affiliated with the OpenStreetMap.org mapping project.
