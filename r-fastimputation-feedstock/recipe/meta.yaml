  summary: TrainFastImputation() uses training data to describe a multivariate normal distribution
    that the data approximates or can be transformed into approximating and stores this
    information as an object of class 'FastImputationPatterns'. FastImputation() function
    uses this 'FastImputationPatterns' object to impute (make a good guess at) missing
    data in a single line or a whole data frame of data.  This approximates the process
    used by 'Amelia' <http://gking.harvard.edu/amelia/> but is much faster when filling
    in values for a single line of data.
