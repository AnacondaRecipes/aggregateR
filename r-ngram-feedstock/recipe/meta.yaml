  summary: An n-gram is a sequence of n "words" taken, in order, from a body of text.  This is
    a collection of utilities for creating, displaying, summarizing, and "babbling"
    n-grams.  The 'tokenization' and "babbling" are handled by very efficient C code,
    which can even be built as its own standalone library. The babbler is a simple Markov
    chain.  The package also offers a vignette with complete example 'workflows' and
    information about the utilities offered in the package.
