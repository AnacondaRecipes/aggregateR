  summary: This package provides functions to compute Marcus, Marcus-Levich-Jortner or Landau-Zener
    charge transfer rates. These rates can then be used to perform kinetic Monte Carlo
    simulations to estimate charge carrier mobilities in molecular materials. The preparation
    of this package was supported by the the Fondazione Cariplo (PLENOS project, ref.
    2011-0349).
