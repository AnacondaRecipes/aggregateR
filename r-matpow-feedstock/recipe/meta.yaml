  summary: A general framework for computing powers of matrices.  A key feature is the capability
    for users to write callback functions, called after each iteration, thus enabling
    customization for specific applications.  Diverse types of matrix classes/matrix
    multiplication are accommodated.  If the multiplication type computes in parallel,
    then the package computation is also parallel.
