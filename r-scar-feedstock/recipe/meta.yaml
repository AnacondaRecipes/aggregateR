  summary: 'This package computes the maximum likelihood estimator of the generalised additive
    and index regression with shape constraints. Each additive component function is
    assumed to obey one of the nine possible shape restrictions: linear, increasing,
    decreasing, convex, convex increasing, convex decreasing, concave, concave increasing,
    or concave decreasing.'
