  summary: 'Computes the maximum likelihood estimator of the generalised additive and index regression
    with shape constraints. Each additive component function is assumed to obey one
    of the nine possible shape restrictions: linear, increasing, decreasing, convex,
    convex increasing, convex decreasing, concave, concave increasing, or concave decreasing.
