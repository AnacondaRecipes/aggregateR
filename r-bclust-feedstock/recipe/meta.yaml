  summary: Builds a dendrogram using log posterior as a natural distance defined by the model
    and meanwhile waits the clustering variables. It is also capable to computing equivalent
    Bayesian discrimination probabilities. The adopted method suites small sample large
    dimension setting. The model parameter estimation maybe difficult, depending on
    data structure and the chosen distribution family.
