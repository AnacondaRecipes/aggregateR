  summary: Cointegration methods are widely used in empirical macroeconomics and empirical finance.
    It is well known that in a cointegrating regression the ordinary least squares (OLS)
    estimator of the parameters is super-consistent, i.e. converges at rate equal to
    the sample size T. When the regressors are endogenous, the limiting distribution
    of the OLS estimator is contaminated by so-called second order bias terms, see e.g.
    Phillips and Hansen (1990) <DOI:10.2307/2297545>. The presence of these bias terms
    renders inference difficult. Consequently, several modifications to OLS that lead
    to zero mean Gaussian mixture limiting distributions have been proposed, which in
    turn make standard asymptotic inference feasible. These methods include the fully
    modified OLS (FM-OLS) approach of Phillips and Hansen (1990) <DOI:10.2307/2297545>,
    the dynamic OLS (D-OLS) approach of Phillips and Loretan (1991) <DOI:10.2307/2298004>,
    Saikkonen (1991) <DOI:10.1017/S0266466600004217> and Stock and Watson (1993) <DOI:10.2307/2951763>
    and the new estimation approach called integrated modified OLS (IM-OLS) of Vogelsang
    and Wagner (2014) <DOI:10.1016/j.jeconom.2013.10.015>. The latter is based on an
    augmented partial sum (integration) transformation of the regression model. IM-OLS
    is similar in spirit to the FM- and D-OLS approaches, with the key difference that
    it does not require estimation of long run variance matrices and avoids the need
    to choose tuning parameters (kernels, bandwidths, lags). However, inference does
    require that a long run variance be scaled out. This package provides functions
    for the parameter estimation and inference with all three modified OLS approaches.
    That includes the automatic bandwidth selection approaches of Andrews (1991) <DOI:10.2307/2938229>
    and of Newey and West (1994) <DOI:10.2307/2297912> as well as the calculation of
    the long run variance.
