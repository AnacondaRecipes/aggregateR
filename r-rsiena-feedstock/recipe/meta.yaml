  summary: 'The main purpose of this package is to perform simulation-based  estimation of stochastic
    actor-oriented models for longitudinal network  data collected as panel data. Dependent
    variables can be single or  multivariate networks, which can be directed, non-directed,
    or two-mode.  There are also functions for testing parameters and checking goodness
    of fit. An overview of these models is given in Tom A.B. Snijders (2017), Stochastic  Actor-Oriented
    Models for Network Dynamics, Annual Review of Statistics and  Its Application, 4,
    343-363 <doi: 10.1146/annurev-statistics-060116-054035>.'
