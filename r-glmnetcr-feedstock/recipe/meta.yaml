  summary: 'Penalized methods are useful for fitting over-parameterized models. This package
    includes functions for restructuring an ordinal  response dataset for fitting continuation
    ratio models for datasets  where the number of covariates exceeds the sample size
    or when    there is collinearity among the covariates. The glmnet fitting algorithm
    is used to fit the continuation ratio model after data restructuring. '
