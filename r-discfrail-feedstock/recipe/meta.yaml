  summary: Functions for fitting Cox proportional hazards models for grouped time-to-event data,
    where the shared group-specific frailties have a discrete nonparametric distribution.
    The methods proposed in the package is described by Gasperoni, F., Ieva, F., Paganoni,
    A. M., Jackson, C. H., Sharples, L. (2018) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxy071>. There
    are also functions for simulating from these models, with a nonparametric or a parametric
    baseline hazard function.
