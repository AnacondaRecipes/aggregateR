  summary: The package BayHap performs simultaneous estimation of uncertain haplotype frequencies
    and association with haplotypes based on generalized linear models for quantitative,
    binary and survival traits. Bayesian statistics and Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques
    are the theoretical framework for the methods of estimation included in this package.
    Prior values for model parameters can be included by the user. Convergence diagnostics
    and statistical and graphical analysis of the sampling output can be also carried
    out.
