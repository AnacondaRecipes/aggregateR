  summary: 'Fit the hierarchical and non-hierarchical Bayesian measurement models proposed by
    Bullock, Imai, and Shapiro (2011) <DOI:10.1093/pan/mpr031> to analyze endorsement
    experiments.  Endorsement experiments are a survey methodology for eliciting truthful
    responses to sensitive questions.  This methodology is helpful when measuring support
    for socially sensitive political actors such as militant groups.  The model is fitted
    with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm and produces the output containing draws
    from the posterior distribution. '
