  summary: Functions that compute the spatial covariance matrix for the matern and power classes
    of spatial models, for data that arise on rectangular units.  This code can also
    be used for the change of support problem and for spatial data that arise on irregularly
    shaped regions like counties or zipcodes by laying a fine grid of rectangles and
    aggregating the integrals in a form of Riemann integration.
