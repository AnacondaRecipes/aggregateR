  summary: Tests for block-diagonal structure in symmetric matrices (e.g. correlation matrices)
    under the null hypothesis of exchangeable off-diagonal elements. As described in
    Segal et al. (2019), these tests can be useful for construct validation either by
    themselves or as a complement to confirmatory factor analysis. Monte Carlo methods
    are used to approximate the permutation p-value with Hubert's Gamma (Hubert, 1976)
    and a t-statistic. This package also implements the chi-squared statistic described
    by Steiger (1980). Please see Segal, et al. (2019) <doi:10.1007/s11336-018-9647-4>
    for more information.
