  summary: Training and prediction functions are provided for the Extreme Learning Machine algorithm
    (ELM). The ELM use a Single Hidden Layer Feedforward Neural Network (SLFN) with
    random generated weights and no gradient-based backpropagation. The training time
    is very short and the online version allows to update the model using small chunk
    of the training set at each iteration. The only parameter to tune is the hidden
    layer size and the learning function.
