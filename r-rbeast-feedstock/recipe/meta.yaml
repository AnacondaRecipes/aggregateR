  summary: Interpretation of time series data is affected by model choices. Different models
    can give different or even contradicting estimates of patterns, trends, and mechanisms
    for the same data--a limitation alleviated by the Bayesian estimator of abrupt change,seasonality,
    and trend (BEAST) of this package. BEAST seeks to improve time series decomposition
    by forgoing the "single-best-model" concept and embracing all competing models into
    the inference via a Bayesian model averaging scheme. It is a flexible tool to uncover
    abrupt changes (i.e., change-points), cyclic variations (e.g., seasonality), and
    nonlinear trends in time-series observations. BEAST not just tells when changes
    occur but also quantifies how likely the detected changes are true. It detects not
    just piecewise linear trends but also arbitrary nonlinear trends. BEAST is applicable
    to real-valued time series data of all kinds, be it for remote sensing, economics,
    climate sciences, ecology, and hydrology. Example applications include its use to
    identify regime shifts in ecological data, map forest disturbance and land degradation
    from satellite imagery, detect market trends in economic data, pinpoint anomaly
    and extreme events in climate data, and unravel system dynamics in biological data.
    Details on BEAST are reported in Zhao et al. (2019) <doi:10.1016/j.rse.2019.04.034>.
