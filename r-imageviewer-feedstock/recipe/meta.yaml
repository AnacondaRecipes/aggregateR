  summary: Display a 2D-matrix data as a interactive zoomable gray-scale image viewer, providing
    tools for manual data inspection. The viewer window shows cursor guiding lines and
    a corresponding data slices for both axes at the current cursor position. A tool-bar
    allows adjusting image display brightness/contrast through WebGL filters and performing
    basic high-pass/low-pass filtering.
