  summary: Structural equation modeling is a powerful statistical approach for the testing of
    networks of direct and indirect theoretical causal relationships in complex data
    sets with inter-correlated dependent and independent variables. Here we implement
    a simple method for spatially explicit structural equation modeling based on the
    analysis of variance co-variance matrices calculated across a range of lag distances.
    This method provides readily interpreted plots of the change in path coefficients
    across scale.
