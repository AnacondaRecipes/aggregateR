  summary: Provides estimation of simultaneous bootstrap and asymptotic confidence intervals
    for diversity indices, namely the Shannon and the Simpson index. Several pre--specified
    multiple comparison types are available to choose. Further user--defined contrast
    matrices are applicable. In addition, simboot estimates adjusted as well as unadjusted
    p--values for two of the three proposed bootstrap methods. Further simboot allows
    for comparing biological diversities of two or more groups while simultaneously
    testing a user-defined selection of Hill numbers of orders q, which are considered
    as appropriate and useful indices for measuring diversity.
