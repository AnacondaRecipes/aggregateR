  summary: 'Demonstration code showing how (univariate) kernel density estimates are computed,
    at least conceptually, and allowing users to experiment with different kernels,
    should they so wish.  The method used follows directly the definition, but gains
    efficiency by replacing the observations by frequencies in a very fine grid covering
    the sample range.  A canonical reference is B. W. Silverman, (1998) <doi: 10.1201/9781315140919>.
    NOTE: the density function in the stats package uses a more sophisticated method
    based on the fast Fourier transform and that function should be used if computational
    efficiency is a prime consideration.'
