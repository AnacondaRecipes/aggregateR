  summary: Variable selection techniques are essential tools for model selection and estimation
    in high-dimensional statistical models. Through this publicly available package,
    we provide a unified environment to carry out variable selection using iterative
    sure independence screening (SIS) (Fan and Lv (2008)<doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2008.00674.x>)
    and all of its variants in generalized linear models (Fan and Song (2009)<doi:10.1214/10-AOS798>)
    and the Cox proportional hazards model (Fan, Feng and Wu (2010)<doi:10.1214/10-IMSCOLL606>).
