  summary: Designed to replace the tables which were in the back of the first two editions of
    Hollander and Wolfe - Nonparametric Statistical Methods.  Exact procedures are performed
    when computationally possible.  Monte Carlo and Asymptotic procedures are performed
    otherwise.  For those procedures included in the base packages, our code simply
    provides a wrapper to standardize the output with the other procedures in the package.
