  summary: Functions and data sets inspired by data sharpening - data perturbation to achieve
    improved performance in nonparametric estimation, as described in Choi, E., Hall,
    P. and Rousson, V. (2000). Capabilities for enhanced local linear regression function
    and derivative estimation are included, as well as an asymptotically correct iterated
    data sharpening estimator for any degree of local polynomial regression estimation.
    A cross-validation-based bandwidth selector is included which, in concert with the
    iterated sharpener, will often provide superior performance, according to a median
    integrated squared error criterion.  Sample data sets are provided to illustrate
    function usage.
