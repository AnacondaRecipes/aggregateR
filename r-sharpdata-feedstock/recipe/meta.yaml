  summary: 'Functions and data sets inspired by data sharpening - data perturbation to achieve
    improved performance in nonparametric estimation, as described in Choi, E., Hall,
    P.  and Rousson, V. (2000) <doi:10.1214/aos/1015957396>.   Capabilities for enhanced
    local linear regression function  and derivative estimation are included, as well
    as an  asymptotically correct iterated data sharpening estimator for any degree
    of local polynomial regression estimation.  A cross-validation-based bandwidth selector
    is included which, in concert with the iterated sharpener, will often provide  superior
    performance, according to a median integrated squared  error criterion.  Sample
    data sets are provided to illustrate  function usage.    '
