  summary: Takes matched and unmatched data and calculates Rosenbaum bounds for the treatment
    effect.  Calculates bounds for binary outcome data, Hodges-Lehmann point estimates,
    Wilcoxon signed-rank test for matched data and matched IV estimators, Wilcoxon sum
    rank test, and for data with multiple matched controls. The sensitivity analysis
    methods in this package are documented in Rosenbaum (2002) Observational Studies,
    <doi:10.1007/978-1-4757-3692-2>, Springer-Verlag.
