  summary: Implements a method of iteratively collapsing the rows of a contingency table, two
    at a time, by selecting the pair of categories whose combination yields a new table
    with the smallest loss of chi-squared, as described by Greenacre, M.J. (1988) <doi:10.1007/BF01901670>.
    The result is compatible with the class of object returned by the 'stats' package's
    hclust() function and can be used similarly (plotted as a dendrogram, cut, etc.).
    Additional functions are provided for automatic cutting and diagnostic plotting.
