  summary: A minimal wrapper around the NIH's 'iCite' API (<https://icite.od.nih.gov/api>).  Given
    a vector of pubmed IDs, this package returns a dataframe of the information yielded
    by the 'iCite' API. The primary metric yielded by 'iCite' is the paper's relative
    citation ratio, but the API also returns other meta-data from the paper, including
    author names, publication journal, publication year, paper title, doi, and a number
    of other citation metrics.
