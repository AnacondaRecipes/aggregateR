  summary: A minimal wrapper around the NIH's 'iCite' API (<https://icite.od.nih.gov/api>). Given
    a vector of pubmed IDs, this package returns a dataframe of the information yielded
    by the 'iCite' API. The primary metrics yielded by 'iCite' are measurements of a
    paper's scientific influence and translational potential, but the API also returns
    other meta-data from the paper, including author names, publication journal, publication
    year, paper title, doi, and a number of other citation metrics.
