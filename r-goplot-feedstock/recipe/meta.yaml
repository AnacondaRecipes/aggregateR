  summary: 'Implementation of multilayered visualizations for enhanced graphical representation
    of functional analysis data. It combines and integrates omics data derived from
    expression and functional annotation enrichment analyses. Its plotting functions
    have been developed with an hierarchical structure in mind: starting from a general
    overview to identify the most enriched categories (modified bar plot, bubble plot)
    to a more detailed one displaying different types of relevant information for the
    molecules in a given set of categories (circle plot, chord plot, cluster plot, Venn
    diagram, heatmap).'
