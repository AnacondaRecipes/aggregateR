  summary: Implements functions from 'EXPOKIT'  (<https://www.maths.uq.edu.au/expokit/>) to calculate  matrix
    exponentials, Sidje RB, (1998) <doi:10.1145/285861.285868>.  Includes functions
    for small dense matrices along with functions  for large sparse matrices. The functions
    for large sparse matrices  implement Krylov subspace methods which help minimise
    the  computational complexity for matrix exponentials. 'Kexpmv' can be  utilised
    to calculate both the matrix exponential in isolation  along with the product of
    the matrix exponential and a vector.
