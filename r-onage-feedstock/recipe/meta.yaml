  summary: Implementation of a likelihood ratio test of differential onset of senescence between
    two groups. Given two groups with measures of age and of an individual trait likely
    to be subjected to senescence (e.g. body mass), 'OnAge' provides an asymptotic p-value
    for the null hypothesis that senescence starts at the same age in both groups. The
    package implements the procedure used in Douhard et al. (2017) <doi:10.1111/oik.04421>.
