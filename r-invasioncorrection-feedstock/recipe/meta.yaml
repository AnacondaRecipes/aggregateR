  summary: The correction is achieved under the assumption that non-migrating cells of the essay
    approximately form a quadratic flow profile due to frictional effects, compare law
    of Hagen-Poiseuille for flow in a tube. The script fits a conical plane to give
    xyz-coordinates of the cells. It outputs the number of migrated cells and the new
    corrected coordinates.
