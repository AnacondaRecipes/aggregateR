  summary: 'In high-dimensional settings: Estimate the number of distant spikes based on the
    Generalized Spiked Population (GSP) model. Estimate the population eigenvalues,
    angles between the sample and population eigenvectors, correlations between the
    sample and population PC scores, and the asymptotic shrinkage factors. Adjust the
    shrinkage bias in the predicted PC scores.'
