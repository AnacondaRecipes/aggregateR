  summary: Estimates the Vevea and Hedges (1995) weight-function model. By specifying arguments,
    users can also estimate the modified model described in Vevea and Woods (2005),
    which may be more practical with small datasets. Users can also specify moderators
    to estimate a linear model. The package functionality allows users to easily extract
    the results of these analyses as R objects for other uses. In addition, the package
    includes a function to launch both models as a Shiny application. Although the Shiny
    application is also available online, this function allows users to launch it locally
    if they choose.
