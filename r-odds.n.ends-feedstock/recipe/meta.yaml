  summary: Computes odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals from a generalized linear model
    object. It also computes model significance with the chi-squared statistic and p-value
    and it computes model fit using a contingency table to determine the percent of
    observations for which the model correctly predicts the value of the outcome. Calculates
    model sensitivity and specificity.
