  summary: Implementations of permutation approach to hypothesis testing for quasi-independence
    of truncation time and failure time. The implemented approaches are powerful against
    non-monotone alternatives and thereby offer protection against erroneous assumptions
    of quasi-independence. The proposed tests use either a conditional or an unconditional
    method to evaluate the permutation p-value. The conditional method was first developed
    in Tsai (1980) <doi:10.2307/2336059> and Efron and Petrosian (1992) <doi:10.1086/171931>.
    The unconditional method provides a valid approximation to the conditional method,
    yet computationally simpler and does not hold fixed the size of each risk sets.
    Users also have an option to carry out the proposed permutation tests in a parallel
    computing fashion.
