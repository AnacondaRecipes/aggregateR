  summary: Creates complex autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models and constructs the underlying
    unrestricted and restricted error correction model (ECM) automatically, just by
    providing the order. It also performs the bounds-test for cointegration as described
    in Pesaran et al. (2001) <doi:10.1002/jae.616> and provides the multipliers and
    the cointegrating equation. The validity and the accuracy of this package have been
    verified by successfully replicating the results of Pesaran et al. (2001) in Natsiopoulos
    and Tzeremes (2022) <doi:10.1002/jae.2919>.
