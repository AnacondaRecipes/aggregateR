  summary: Methods include converting series of event names to strings, finding common patterns
    in a group of strings, discovering featured patterns when comparing two groups of
    strings as well as the number and starting position of each pattern in each string,
    obtaining transition matrix,  computing transition entropy, statistically comparing
    the difference between two groups of strings, and clustering string groups. Event
    names can be any action names or labels such as events in log files or areas of
    interest (AOIs) in eye tracking research.
