  summary: Provides global hypothesis tests, multiple testing procedures and simultaneous confidence
    intervals for multiple linear contrasts of regression coefficients in a single generalized
    estimating equation (GEE) model or across multiple GEE models. GEE models are fit
    by a modified version of the 'geeM' package.
