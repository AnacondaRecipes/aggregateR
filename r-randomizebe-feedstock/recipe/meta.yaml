  summary: Contains a function to randomize subjects, patients in groups of  sequences (treatment
    sequences). If a blocksize is given, the randomization will be done within blocks.
    The randomization may be controlled by a Wald-Wolfowitz runs test. Functions to
    obtain the p-value of that test are included. The package is mainly intended for
    randomization of bioequivalence studies but may be used also for other clinical
    crossover studies. Contains two helper functions sequences() and williams() to get
    the sequences  of commonly used designs in BE studies.
