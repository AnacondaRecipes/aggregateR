  summary: Routines for estimating tree fiber (tracheid) length distributions in the standing
    tree based on increment core samples. Two types of data can be used with the package,
    increment core data measured by means of an optical fiber analyzer (OFA), e.g. such
    as the Kajaani Fiber Lab, or measured by microscopy. Increment core data analyzed
    by OFAs consist of the cell lengths of both cut and uncut fibres (tracheids) and
    fines (such as ray parenchyma cells) without being able to identify which cells
    are cut or if they are fines or fibres. The microscopy measured data consist of
    the observed lengths of the uncut fibres in the increment core. A censored version
    of a mixture of the fine and fiber length distributions is proposed to fit the OFA
    data, under distributional assumptions (Svensson et al., 2006) <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9469.2006.00501.x>.
    The package offers two choices for the assumptions of the underlying density functions
    of the true fiber (fine) lenghts of those fibers (fines) that at least partially
    appear in the increment core, being the generalized gamma and the log normal densities.
