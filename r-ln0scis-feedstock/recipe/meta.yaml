  summary: Construct the simultaneous confidence intervals for ratios of means of Log-normal
    populations with zeros. It also has a Python module that do the same thing, and
    can be applied to multiple comparisons of parameters of any k mixture distributions.
    And we provide four methods, the method based on generalized pivotal quantity with
    order statistics and the quantity based on Wilson by Li et al. (2009) <doi:10.1016/j.spl.2009.03.004>
    (GPQW), and the methods based on  generalized pivotal quantity with order statistics
    and the quantity based on Hannig (2009) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asp050> (GPQH). The
    other two methods are  based on two-step MOVER intervals by Amany H, Abdel K (2015)
    <doi:10.1080/03610918.2013.767911>. We deduce Fiducial generalized pivotal two-step
    MOVER intervals based on  Wilson quantity (FMW) and based on Hannig's quantity (FMWH).
    All these approach you can find in the paper of us which it has been submitted.
