  summary: Provides extra functions to manipulate dendrograms that build on the base functions
    provided by the 'stats' package. The main functionality it is designed to add is
    the ability to colour all the edges in an object of class 'dendrogram' according
    to cluster membership i.e. each subtree is coloured, not just the terminal leaves.
    In addition it provides some utility functions to cut 'dendrogram' and 'hclust'
    objects and to set/get labels.
