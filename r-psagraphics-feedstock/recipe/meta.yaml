  summary: 'A collection of functions that primarily produce graphics to aid in a Propensity
    Score Analysis (PSA).  Functions include: cat.psa and box.psa to test balance within
    strata of categorical and quantitative covariates, circ.psa for a representation
    of the estimated effect size by stratum, loess.psa that provides a graphic and loess
    based effect size estimate, and various balance functions that provide measures
    of the balance achieved via a PSA in a categorical covariate.'
