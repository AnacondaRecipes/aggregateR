  license: MIT
  summary: Provides an R interface to 'Julia', which is a high-level, high-performance dynamic
    programming language for numerical computing, see <https://julialang.org/> for more
    information. It provides a high-level interface as well as a low-level interface.
    Using the high level interface, you could call any 'Julia' function just like any
    R function with automatic type conversion. Using the low level interface, you could
    deal with C-level SEXP directly while enjoying the convenience of using a high-level
    programming language like 'Julia'.
