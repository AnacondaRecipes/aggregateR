  summary: Automates common plotting tasks to ease data exploration. Makes density plots (potentially
    overlaid on histograms), scatter plots with prediction lines, or bar or line plots
    with error bars. For each type, y, or x and y variables can be plotted at levels
    of other variables, all with minimal specification.
