  summary: 'Inference procedures accommodate a flexible range of hazard ratio patterns with a
    two-sample semi-parametric model. This model contains the proportional hazards model
    and the proportional odds model as sub-models, and accommodates non-proportional
    hazards situations to the extreme of having crossing hazards and crossing survivor
    functions. Overall, this package has four major functions: 1) the parameter estimation,
    namely short-term and long-term hazard ratio parameters; 2) 95 percent and 90 percent
    point-wise confidence intervals and simultaneous confidence bands for the hazard
    ratio function; 3) p-value of the adaptive weighted log-rank test; 4) p-values of
    two lack-of-fit tests for the model. See the included "read_me_first.pdf" for brief
    instructions. In this version (1.1), there is no need to sort the data before applying
    this package.'
