  summary: '`ctab'' creates (multiway) percentage tables. `sqtab'' contains a set of functions
    for estimating models for square tables such as quasi-independence, symmetry, uniform
    association. Examples show how to use these models in a loglinear model using glm
    or in a multinomial logistic model using mlogit or clogit'
