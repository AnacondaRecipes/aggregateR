  summary: 'Baseline correction, normalization and linear combination fitting (LCF) of X-ray
    absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra. The package includes data loading
    of .xmu files exported from ''ATHENA'' (Ravel and Newville, 2005) <doi:10.1107/S0909049505012719>.
    Loaded spectra can be background corrected and all standards can be fitted at once.
    Two linear combination fitting functions can be used: (1) fit_athena(): Simply fitting
    combinations of standards as in ATHENA, (2) fit_float(): Fitting all standards with
    changing baseline correction and edge-step normalization parameters.'
