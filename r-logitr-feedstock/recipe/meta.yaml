  summary: Fast estimation of multinomial (MNL) and mixed logit (MXL) models in R. Models can
    be estimated using "Preference" space or "Willingness-to-pay" (WTP) space utility
    parameterizations. Weighted models can also be estimated. An option is available
    to run a parallelized multistart optimization loop with random starting points in
    each iteration, which is useful for non-convex problems like MXL models or models
    with WTP space utility parameterizations. The main optimization loop uses the 'nloptr'
    package to minimize the negative log-likelihood function. Additional functions are
    available for computing and comparing WTP from both preference space and WTP space
    models and for predicting expected choices and choice probabilities for sets of
    alternatives based on an estimated model. Mixed logit models can include uncorrelated
    or correlated heterogeneity covariances and are estimated using maximum simulated
    likelihood based on the algorithms in Train (2009) <doi:10.1017/CBO9780511805271>.
