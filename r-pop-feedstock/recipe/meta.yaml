  summary: Population dynamic models underpin a range of analyses and applications in ecology
    and epidemiology. The various approaches for analysing population dynamics models
    (MPMs, IPMs, ODEs, POMPs, PVA) each require the model to be defined in a different
    way. This makes it difficult to combine different modelling approaches and data
    types to solve a given problem. 'pop' aims to provide a flexible and easy to use
    common interface for constructing population dynamic models and enabling to them
    to be fitted and analysed in lots of different ways.
