  summary: 'The robustness of many of the statistical techniques, such as factor analysis, applied
    in the social sciences rests upon the assumption of item-level normality. However,
    when dealing with real data, these assumptions are often not met. The Box-Cox transformation
    (Box & Cox, 1964) <http://www.jstor.org/stable/2984418> provides an optimal transformation
    for non-normal variables. Yet, for large datasets of continuous variables, its application
    in current software programs is cumbersome with analysts having to take several
    steps to normalise each variable. We present an R package ''normalr'' that enables
    researchers to make convenient optimal transformations of multiple variables in
    datasets. This R package enables users to quickly and accurately: (1) anchor all
    of their variables at 1.00, (2) select the desired precision with which the optimal
    lambda is estimated, (3) apply each unique exponent to its variable, (4) rescale
    resultant values to within their original X1 and X(n) ranges, and (5) provide original
    and transformed estimates of skewness, kurtosis, and other inferential assessments
    of normality.'
