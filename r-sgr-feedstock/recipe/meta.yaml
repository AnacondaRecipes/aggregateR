  summary: The package for Sample Generation by Replacement simulations (SGR; Lombardi & Pastore,
    2014; Pastore & Lombardi, 2014). The package can be used to perform fake data analysis
    according to the sample generation by replacement approach. It includes functions
    for making simple inferences about discrete/ordinal fake data. The package allows
    to study the implications of fake data for empirical results.
