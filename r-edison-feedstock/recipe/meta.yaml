  summary: Package EDISON (Estimation of Directed Interactions from Sequences Of Non-homogeneous
    gene expression) runs an MCMC simulation to reconstruct networks from time series
    data, using a non-homogeneous, time-varying dynamic Bayesian network. Networks segments
    and changepoints are inferred concurrently, and information sharing priors provide
    a reduction of the inference uncertainty.
