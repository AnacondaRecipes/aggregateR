  summary: Solves kernel ridge regression, within the the mixed model framework, for the linear,
    polynomial, Gaussian, Laplacian and ANOVA kernels. The model components (i.e. fixed
    and random effects) and variance parameters are estimated using the expectation-maximization
    (EM) algorithm. All the estimated components and parameters, e.g. BLUP of dual variables
    and BLUP of random predictor effects for the linear kernel (also known as RR-BLUP),
    are available. The kernel ridge mixed model (KRMM) is described in Jacquin L, Cao
    T-V and Ahmadi N (2016) A Unified and Comprehensible View of Parametric and Kernel
    Methods for Genomic Prediction with Application to Rice. Front. Genet. 7:145. <doi:10.3389/fgene.2016.00145>.
