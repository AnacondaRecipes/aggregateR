  summary: The detection of worrying approximate collinearity in a multiple linear regression
    model is a problem addressed in all existing statistical packages. However, we have
    detected deficits regarding to the incorrect treatment of qualitative independent
    variables and the role of the intercept of the model. The objective of this package
    is to correct these deficits. In this package will be available detection and treatment
    techniques traditionally used as the recently developed.
