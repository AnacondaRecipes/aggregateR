  summary: A method for automatic detection of peaks in noisy periodic and quasi-periodic signals.
    This method, called automatic multiscale-based peak detection (AMPD), is based on
    the calculation and analysis of the local maxima scalogram, a matrix comprising
    the scale-dependent occurrences of local maxima. For further information see  <doi:10.3390/a5040588>.
