  summary: Implement a coherent and flexible protocol for animal color tagging. 'GenTag' provides
    a simple computational routine with low CPU usage to create color sequences for
    animal tag. First, a single-color tag sequence is created from an algorithm selected
    by the user, followed by verification of the combination uniqueness. Three methods
    to produce color tag sequences are provided. Users can modify the main function
    core to allow a wide range of applications.
