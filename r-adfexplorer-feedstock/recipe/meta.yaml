  summary: Amiga Disk Files (ADF) are virtual representations of 3.5 inch floppy disks for the
    Commodore Amiga. Most disk drives from other systems (including modern drives) are
    not able to read these disks. To be able to emulate this system, the ADF format
    was created. This package enables you to read ADF files and import and export files
    from and to such virtual DOS-formatted disks.
