  summary: A generalized coordinate descent (GCD) algorithm for computing the solution path of
    the hybrid Huberized support vector machine (HHSVM) and its generalization, including
    the LASSO and elastic net (adaptive) penalized least squares, logistic regression,
    HHSVM, squared hinge loss SVM and expectile regression.
