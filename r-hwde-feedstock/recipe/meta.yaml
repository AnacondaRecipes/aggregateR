  summary: Fits models for genotypic disequilibria, as described in Huttley and Wilson (2000),
    Weir (1996) and Weir and Wilson (1986). Contrast terms are available that account
    for first order interactions between loci.  Also implements, for a single locus
    in a single population, a conditional exact test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
