  summary: Provides reference classes implementing some useful data structures. The package implements
    these data structures by using the reference class R6. Therefore, the classes of
    the data structures are also reference classes which means that their instances
    are passed by reference. The implemented data structures include stack, queue, double-ended
    queue, doubly linked list, set, dictionary and binary search tree. See for example
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure> for more information about the data
    structures.
