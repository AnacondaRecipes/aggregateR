  summary: 'This package is a gene set analysis function for one-sided test (OLS), two-sided
    test (multivariate analysis of variance). If the experimental conditions are equal
    to 2, the p-value for Hotelling''s t^2 test is calculated. If the experimental conditions
    are great than 2, the p-value for Wilks'' Lambda is determined and post-hoc test
    is reported too. Three multiple comparison procedures, Dunnett, Tukey, and sequential
    pairwise comparison, are implemented. The program computes the p-values and FDR
    (false discovery rate) q-values for all gene sets. The p-values for individual genes
    in a significant gene set are also listed. MAVTgsa generates two visualization output:
    a p-value plot of gene sets (GSA plot) and a GST-plot of the empirical distribution
    function of the ranked test statistics of a given gene set. A Random Forests-based
    procedure is to identify gene sets that can accurately predict samples from different
    experimental conditions or are associated with the continuous phenotypes.'
