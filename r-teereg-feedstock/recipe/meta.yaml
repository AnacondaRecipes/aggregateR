  summary: 'For fitting multiple linear regressions, the ordinary least squares approach is sensitive
    to outliers and/or violations of model assumptions. The trimmed elemental estimators
    are more robust to such situations. This package contains functions for computing
    the trimmed elemental estimates, as well as for creating the bias-corrected and
    accelerated bootstrap confidence intervals based on elemental regressions. '
