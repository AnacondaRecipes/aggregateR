  summary: Arithmetic operations scalar multiplication, addition, subtraction, multiplication
    and division of LR fuzzy numbers (which are on the basis of extension principle)
    have a complicate form for using in fuzzy Statistics, fuzzy Mathematics, machine
    learning, fuzzy data analysis and etc. Calculator for LR Fuzzy Numbers package relieve
    and aid applied users to achieve a simple and closed form for some complicated operator
    based on LR fuzzy numbers and also the user can easily draw the membership function
    of the obtained result by this package.
