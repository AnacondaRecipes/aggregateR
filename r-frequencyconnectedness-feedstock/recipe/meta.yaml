  summary: Accompanies a paper (Barunik, Krehlik (2018) <doi:10.1093/jjfinec/nby001>) dedicated
    to spectral decomposition of connectedness measures and their interpretation. We
    implement all the developed estimators as well as the historical counterparts. For
    more information, see the help or GitHub page (<https://github.com/tomaskrehlik/frequencyConnectedness>)
