  summary: Extensive penalized variable selection methods have been developed in the past two
    decades for analyzing high dimensional omics data, such as gene expressions, single
    nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), copy number variations (CNVs) and others. However,
    lipidomics data have been rarely investigated by using high dimensional variable
    selection methods. This package incorporates our recently developed penalization
    procedures to conduct interaction analysis for high dimensional lipidomics data
    with repeated measurements. The core module of this package is developed in C++.
    The development of this software package and the associated statistical methods
    have been partially supported by an Innovative Research Award from Johnson Cancer
    Research Center, Kansas State University.
