  summary: Tools to sort, edit and prune pedigrees and to extract the inbreeding coefficients
    and the relationship matrix (includes code for pedigrees from self-pollinated species).  The
    use of pedigree data is central to genetics research within the animal and plant
    breeding communities to predict  breeding values. The relationship matrix between
    the individuals can be derived from pedigree structure following the algorithms
    described for example in Vazquez et al., 2010 <doi:10.2527/jas.2009-1952>.
