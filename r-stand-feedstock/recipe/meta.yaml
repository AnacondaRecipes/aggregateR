  summary: Provides functions for the analysis of occupational and environmental data with non-detects.
    Maximum likelihood (ML) methods for censored log-normal data and non-parametric
    methods based on the product limit estimate (PLE) for left censored data are used
    to calculate all of the statistics recommended by the American Industrial Hygiene
    Association (AIHA) for the complete data case. Functions for the analysis of complete
    samples using exact methods are also provided for the lognormal model. Revised from
    2007-11-05 'survfit~1'.
