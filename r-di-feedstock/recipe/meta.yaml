  summary: A set of utilities for calculating the Deficit (frailty) Index (DI) in gerontological
    studies.  The deficit index was first proposed by Arnold Mitnitski and Kenneth Rockwood  and
    represents a proxy measure of aging and also can be served as a sensitive predictor
    of survival. For more information, see  (i)"Accumulation of Deficits as a Proxy
    Measure of Aging"  by Arnold B. Mitnitski et al. (2001),  The Scientific World Journal
    1, <DOI:10.1100/tsw.2001.58>; (ii) "Frailty, fitness and late-life mortality in
