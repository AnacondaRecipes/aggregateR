  summary: Computes the joint probability mass function (pmf), the joint cumulative function
    (cdf), the joint survival function (sf), the correlation coefficient, the covariance,
    the cross-factorial moment and generate random deviates for the Basu-Dhar bivariate
    geometric distribution as well the joint probability mass, cumulative and survival
    function assuming the presence of a cure fraction given by the standard bivariate
    mixture cure fraction model. The package also computes the estimators based on the
    method of moments.
