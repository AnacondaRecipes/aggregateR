  summary: The straightforward filtering index (SFINX) identifies true positive protein interactions
    in a fast, user-friendly, and highly accurate way. It is not only useful for the
    filtering of affinity purification - mass spectrometry (AP-MS) data, but also for
    similar types of data resulting from other co-complex interactomics technologies,
    such as TAP-MS, Virotrap and BioID. SFINX can also be used via the website interface
    at <http://sfinx.ugent.be>.
