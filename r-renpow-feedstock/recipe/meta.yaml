  summary: Supports calculations and visualization for renewable power systems and the environment.
    Analysis and graphical tools for DC and AC circuits and their use in electric power
    systems. Analysis and graphical tools for thermodynamic cycles and heat engines,
    supporting efficiency calculations in coal-fired power plants, gas-fired power plants.
    Calculations of carbon emissions and atmospheric CO2 dynamics. Analysis of power
    flow and demand for the grid, as well as power models for microgrids and off-grid
    systems. Provides resource and power generation for hydro power, wind power, and
    solar power.
