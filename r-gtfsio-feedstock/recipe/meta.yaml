  summary: Tools for the development of packages related to General Transit Feed Specification
    (GTFS) files. Establishes a standard for representing GTFS feeds using R data types.
    Provides fast and flexible functions to read and write GTFS feeds while sticking
    to this standard. Defines a basic 'gtfs' class which is meant to be extended by
    packages that depend on it. And offers utility functions that support checking the
    structure of GTFS objects.
