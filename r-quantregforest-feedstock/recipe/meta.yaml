  summary: Quantile Regression Forests is a tree-based ensemble method for estimation of conditional
    quantiles. It is particularly well suited for high-dimensional data. Predictor variables
    of mixed classes can be handled. The package is dependent on the package 'randomForest',
    written by Andy Liaw.
