  summary: Contains functions for estimating a mixed-effects model for clustered data (or batch-processed
    data) with cluster-level (or batch- level) missing values in the outcome, i.e.,
    the outcomes of some clusters are either all observed or missing altogether. The
    model is developed for analyzing incomplete data from labeling-based quantitative
    proteomics experiments but is not limited to this type of data. We used an expectation
    conditional maximization (ECM) algorithm for model estimation. The cluster-level
    missingness may depend on the average value of the outcome in the cluster (missing
    not at random).
