  summary: 'An implementation of the sandwich smoother proposed in Fast Bivariate Penalized Splines
    by Xiao et al. (2012) <doi:10.1111/rssb.12007>.    A hero is a specific type of
    sandwich.  Dictionary.com (2018) <https://www.dictionary.com> describes a hero as:
    a large sandwich, usually consisting of a small loaf of bread or long roll cut in
    half lengthwise and containing a variety of ingredients, as meat, cheese, lettuce,
    and tomatoes. Also implements the spatio-temporal sandwich smoother of French and
    Kokoszka (2021) <doi:10.1016/j.spasta.2020.100413>.'
