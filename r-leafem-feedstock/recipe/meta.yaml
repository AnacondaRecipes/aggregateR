  summary: Provides extensions for packages 'leaflet' & 'mapdeck', many of which are used by
    package 'mapview'. Focus is on functionality readily available in Geographic Information
    Systems such as 'Quantum GIS'. Includes functions to display coordinates of mouse
    pointer position, query image values via mouse pointer and zoom-to-layer buttons.
    Additionally, provides a feature type agnostic function to add points, lines, polygons
    to a map.
