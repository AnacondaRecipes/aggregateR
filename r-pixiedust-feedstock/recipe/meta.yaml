  summary: The introduction of the 'broom' package has made converting model objects into data
    frames as simple as a single function. While the 'broom' package focuses on providing
    tidy data frames that can be used in advanced analysis, it deliberately stops short
    of providing functionality for reporting models in publication-ready tables. 'pixiedust'
    provides this functionality with a programming interface intended to be similar
    to 'ggplot2's system of layers with fine tuned control over each cell of the table.
    Options for output include printing to the console and to the common markdown formats
    (markdown, HTML, and LaTeX). With a little 'pixiedust' (and happy thoughts) tables
    can really fly.
