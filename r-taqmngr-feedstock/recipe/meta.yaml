  summary: Manager of tick-by-tick transaction data that performs 'cleaning', 'aggregation' and
    'import' in an efficient and fast way. The package engine, written in C++, exploits
    the 'zlib' and 'gzstream' libraries to handle gzipped data without need to uncompress
    them. 'Cleaning' and 'aggregation' are performed according to Brownlees and Gallo
    (2006) <DOI:10.1016/j.csda.2006.09.030>. Currently, TAQMNGR processes raw data from
    WRDS (Wharton Research Data Service, <https://wrds-web.wharton.upenn.edu/wrds/>).
