  summary: Routines for solving systems of delay differential equations by interfacing numerical
    routines written by Simon N. Wood , with contributions by Benjamin J. Cairns. These
    numerical routines first appeared in Simon Wood's 'solv95' program. This package
    includes a vignette and a complete user's guide. 'PBSddesolve' originally appeared
    on CRAN under the name 'ddesolve'. That version is no longer supported. The current
    name emphasizes a close association with other PBS packages, particularly 'PBSmodelling'.
