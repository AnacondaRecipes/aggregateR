  summary: Functions for solving systems of delay differential equations by interfacing with
    numerical routines written by Simon N. Wood, including contributions from Benjamin
    J. Cairns. These numerical routines first appeared in Simon Wood's 'solv95' program.
    This package includes a vignette and a complete user's guide. 'PBSddesolve' originally
    appeared on CRAN under the name 'ddesolve'. That version is no longer supported.
    The current name emphasizes a close association with other 'PBS' packages, particularly
    'PBSmodelling'.
