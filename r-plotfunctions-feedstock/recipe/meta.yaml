  summary: 'When analyzing data, plots are a helpful tool for visualizing data and interpreting
    statistical models. This package provides a set of simple tools for building plots
    incrementally, starting with an empty plot region, and adding bars, data points,
    regression lines, error bars, gradient legends, density distributions in the margins,
    and even pictures. The package builds further on R graphics by simply combining
    functions and settings in order to reduce the amount of code to produce for the
    user. As a result, the package does not use formula input or special syntax, but
    can be used in combination with default R plot functions. Note: Most of the functions
    were part of the package ''itsadug'', which is now split in two packages: 1. the
    package ''itsadug'', which contains the core functions for visualizing and evaluating
    nonlinear regression models, and 2. the package ''plotfunctions'', which contains
    more general plot functions.'
