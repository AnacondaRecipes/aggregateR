  summary: Allows calculation on, and sampling from Gibbs Random Fields, and more precisely general  homogeneous
    Potts model. The primary tool is the exact computation of the intractable normalising
    constant for small rectangular lattices.  Beside the latter function, it contains
    method that give exact sample from the likelihood for small enough rectangular lattices
    or approximate sample from the  likelihood using MCMC samplers for large lattices.
