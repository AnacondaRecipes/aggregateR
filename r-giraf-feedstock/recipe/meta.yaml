  summary: Allows calculation on, and sampling from Gibbs Random Fields, and more precisely general
    homogeneous Potts model. The primary tool is the exact computation of the intractable
    normalising constant for small rectangular lattices. Beside the latter function,
    it contains method that give exact sample from the likelihood for small enough rectangular
    lattices or approximate sample from the likelihood using MCMC samplers for large
    lattices.
