  summary: Aggregate Business Tendency Survey Data (and other qualitative surveys) to time series
    at various aggregation levels. Run aggregation of survey data in a speedy, re-traceable
    and a easily deployable way. Aggregation is substantially accelerated by use of
    data.table. This package intends to provide an interface that is less general and
    abstract than data.table but rather geared towards survey researchers.
