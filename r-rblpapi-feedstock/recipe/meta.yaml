# Description: An R Interface to 'Bloomberg' is provided via the 'Blp API'.
# SystemRequirements: A valid Bloomberg installation. The API headers and dynamic library are downloaded from <https://github.com/Rblp/blp> during the build step. See <https://bloomberg.github.io/blpapi-docs/cpp/3.8> as well as <https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/support/api-library/> for API documentation. A compiler recent enough for (at least partial) C++11 support is required; g++-4.6.* or later should be sufficient and g++-4.9.* or later is preferred.
