  summary: A convenience package for use while drafting code. It facilitates making stand-out
    comment lines decorated with bands of characters.  The input text strings are converted
    into R comment lines, suitably formatted. These are then displayed in a console
    window and, if possible, automatically transferred to a clipboard ready for pasting
    into an R script.  Designed to save time when drafting R scripts that will need
    to be navigated and maintained by other programmers.
