  summary: A graphical user interface to compute group sequential designs based on normally distributed
    test statistics, particularly critical boundaries, power, drift, and confidence
    intervals of such designs. All computations are based on the alpha spending approach
    by Lan-DeMets with various alpha spending functions being available to choose among.
