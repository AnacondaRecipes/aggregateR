  summary: Hierarchical continuous (and discrete) time state space modelling, for linear and
    nonlinear systems measured by  continuous variables, with limited support for binary
    data. The subject specific dynamic system is modelled as a stochastic differential
    equation (SDE) or difference equation, measurement models are typically multivariate
    normal factor models. Linear mixed effects SDE's estimated via maximum likelihood
    and optimization are the default. Nonlinearities,  (state dependent parameters)
    and random effects on all parameters are possible, using either max likelihood /
    max a posteriori optimization (with optional importance sampling) or Stan's Hamiltonian
    Monte Carlo sampling. See  <https://github.com/cdriveraus/ctsem/raw/master/vignettes/hierarchicalmanual.pdf>
    for details. Priors may be used. For the conceptual overview of the hierarchical
    Bayesian linear SDE approach, see <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324093594_Hierarchical_Bayesian_Continuous_Time_Dynamic_Modeling>.
