  summary: Abridged data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) for years 2003-2016. The ATUS
    is an annual survey conducted on a sample of individuals across the United States
    studying how individuals spent their time over the course of a day. Individual respondents
    were interviewed about what activities they did, during what times (rounded to 15
    minute increments), at what locations, and in the presence of which individuals.
    The activities are subsequently encoded based on 3 separate tier codes for classification.
    This package includes data from the multi-year ATUS Activities, ATUS-CPS, and ATUS
    Respondents files were included. Columns were selected based on completeness of
    data as well as presence on the Frequently Used Variables list provided by the ATUS
    website. All activity codes (other than code '50' for 'Unable to Code') were included.
    Permission was obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for inclusion in this
    package. The full data can be obtained from <http://www.bls.gov/tus/>.
