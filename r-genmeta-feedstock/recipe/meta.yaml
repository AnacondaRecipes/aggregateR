  summary: Generalized meta-analysis is a technique for estimating parameters associated with
    a multiple regression model through meta-analysis of studies which may have information
    only on partial sets of the regressors. It estimates the effects of each variable
    while fully adjusting for all other variables that are measured in at least one
    of the studies. Using algebraic relationships between regression parameters in different
    dimensions, a set of moment equations is specified for estimating the parameters
    of a maximal model through information available on sets of parameter estimates
    from a series of reduced models available from the different studies. The specification
    of the equations requires a reference dataset to estimate the joint distribution
    of the covariates. These equations are solved using the generalized method of moments
    approach, with the optimal weighting of the equations taking into account uncertainty
    associated with estimates of the parameters of the reduced models. The proposed
    framework is implemented using iterated reweighted least squares algorithm for fitting
    generalized linear regression models. For more details about the method, please
    see pre-print version of the manuscript on generalized meta-analysis by Prosenjit
    Kundu, Runlong Tang and Nilanjan Chatterjee (2018) <arXiv:1708.03818>.
