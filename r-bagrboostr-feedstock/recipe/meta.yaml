  summary: bagRboostR is a set of ensemble classifiers for multinomial classification. The bagging
    function is the implementation of Breiman's ensemble as described by Opitz & Maclin
    (1999). The boosting function is the implementation of Stagewise Additive Modeling
    using a Multi-class Exponential loss function (SAMME) created by Zhu et al (2006).
    Both bagging and SAMME implementations use randomForest as the weak classifier and
    expect a character outcome variable.  Each ensemble classifier returns a character
    vector of predictions for the test set.
