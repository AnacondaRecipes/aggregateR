  summary: Utilities for reading data from the Human Mortality Database (<https://www.mortality.org>),
    Human Fertility Database (<https://www.humanfertility.org>), and similar databases
    from the web or locally into an R session as data.frame objects. These are the two
    most widely used sources of demographic data to study basic demographic change,
    trends, and develop new demographic methods. Other supported databases at this time
    include the Human Fertility Collection (<http://www.fertilitydata.org/>), The Japanese
    Mortality Database (<http://www.ipss.go.jp/p-toukei/JMD>), and the Canadian Human
    Mortality Database (<http://www.bdlc.umontreal.ca/chmd/>). Arguments and data are
    standardized.
