  summary: Assists the evaluation of whether and where to focus code optimization, using Amdahl's
    law and visual aids based on line profiling. Amdahl's profiler organizes profiling
    output files (including memory profiling) in a visually appealing way. It is meant
    to help to balance development vs. execution time by helping to identify the most
    promising sections of code to optimize and projecting potential gains. The package
    is an addition to R's standard profiling tools and is not a wrapper for them.
