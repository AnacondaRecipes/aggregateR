  summary: This work is an extension of the state space model for Poisson count data, Poisson-Gamma
    model, towards a semiparametric specification. Just like the generalized additive
    models (GAM), cubic splines are used for covariate smoothing. The semiparametric
    models are fitted by an iterative process that combines maximization of likelihood
    and backfitting algorithm.
