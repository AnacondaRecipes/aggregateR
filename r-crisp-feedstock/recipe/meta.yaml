  summary: 'Implements convex regression with interpretable sharp partitions (CRISP), which considers
    the problem of predicting an outcome variable on the basis of two covariates, using
    an interpretable yet non-additive model. CRISP partitions the covariate space into
    blocks in a data-adaptive way, and fits a mean model within each block. Unlike other
    partitioning methods, CRISP is fit using a non-greedy approach by solving a convex
    optimization problem, resulting in low-variance fits. More details are provided
    in Petersen, A., Simon, N., and Witten, D. (2016). Convex Regression with Interpretable
    Sharp Partitions. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 17(94): 1-31 <http://jmlr.org/papers/volume17/15-344/15-344.pdf>.'
