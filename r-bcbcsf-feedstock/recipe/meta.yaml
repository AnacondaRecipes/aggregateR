  summary: Fully Bayesian Classification with a subset of high-dimensional features, such as
    expression levels of genes. The data are modeled with a hierarchical Bayesian models
    using heavy-tailed t distributions as priors. When a large number of features are
    available, one may like to select only a subset of features to use, typically those
    features strongly correlated with the response in training cases. Such a feature
    selection procedure is however invalid since the relationship between the response
    and the features has be exaggerated by feature selection. This package provides
    a way to avoid this bias and yield better-calibrated predictions for future cases
    when one uses F-statistic to select features.
