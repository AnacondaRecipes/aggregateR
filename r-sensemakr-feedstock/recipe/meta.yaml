  summary: Implements a suite of sensitivity analysis tools  that extends the traditional omitted
    variable bias framework and makes it easier  to understand the impact of omitted
    variables in regression models, as discussed in Cinelli and Hazlett (2018)  <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322509816_Making_Sense_of_Sensitivity_Extending_Omitted_Variable_Bias>.
