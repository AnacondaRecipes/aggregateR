  summary: Computes a universal numeric fingerprint (UNF) for an R data object. UNF is a cryptographic
    hash or signature that can be used to uniquely identify (a version of) a rectangular
    dataset, or a subset thereof. UNF can be used, in tandem with a DOI, to form a persistent
    citation to a versioned dataset.
