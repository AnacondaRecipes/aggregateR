  summary: This package provides the function to calculate SVD, regularized SVD, robust SVD and
    robust regularized SVD method. The robust SVD methods use alternating iteratively
    reweighted least squares methods. The regularized SVD uses generalized cross validation
    to choose the optimal smoothing parameters.
