  summary: This package provides the estimation of an index measuring the clinical utility of
    DNA testing in the context of gene-environment interactions on a disease. The corresponding
    gene-environment interaction effect on the additive scale can also be obtained.
    The estimation is based on case-control or cohort data. The method was developed
    by Nguyen et al. 2013.
