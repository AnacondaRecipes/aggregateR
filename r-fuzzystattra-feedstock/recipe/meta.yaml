  summary: The aim of the package is to provide some basic functions for doing statistics with
    trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. In particular, the package contains several functions
    for simulating trapezoidal  fuzzy numbers, as well as for calculating some central
    tendency  measures (mean and two types of median), some scale measures  (variance,
    ADD, MDD, Sn, Qn, Tn and some M-estimators) and  one diversity index and one inequality
    index. Moreover,  functions for calculating the 1-norm distance, the mid/spr  distance
    and the (phi,theta)-wabl/ldev/rdev distance between  fuzzy numbers are included,
    and a function to calculate the  value phi-wabl given a sample of trapezoidal fuzzy
    numbers.
