  summary: 'Main properties and regression procedures using a generalization of the Dirichlet
    distribution called Simplicial Generalized Beta distribution. It is a new distribution
    on the simplex (i.e. on the space of compositions or positive vectors with sum of
    components equal to 1). The Dirichlet distribution can be constructed from a random
    vector of independent Gamma variables divided by their sum. The SGB follows the
    same construction with generalized Gamma instead of Gamma variables. The Dirichlet
    exponents are supplemented by an overall shape parameter and a vector of scales.
    The scale vector is itself a composition and can be modeled with auxiliary variables
    through a log-ratio transformation. Graf, M. (2017, ISBN: 978-84-947240-0-8). See
    also the vignette enclosed in the package.'
