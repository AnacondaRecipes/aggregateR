  summary: Provides methods for closed testing using Simes local tests. In particular, calculates
    adjusted p-values for Hommel's multiple testing method, and provides lower confidence
    bounds for true discovery proportions. A robust but more conservative variant of
    the closed testing procedure that does not require the assumption of Simes inequality
    is also implemented. The methods have been described in detail in Goeman et al (2016)
    <arXiv:1611.06739v2>.
