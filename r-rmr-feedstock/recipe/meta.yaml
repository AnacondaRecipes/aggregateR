  summary: Analysis of oxygen consumption data generated by Loligo (R) Systems respirometry equipment.
    The package includes a function for loading data output by Loligo's 'AutoResp' software
    (get.witrox.data()), functions for calculating metabolic rates over user-specified
    time intervals, extracting critical points from data using broken stick regressions
    based on Yeager and Ultsch (<DOI:10.1086/physzool.62.4.30157935>), and easy functions
    for converting between different units of barometric pressure.
