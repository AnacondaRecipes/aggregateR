  summary: The aim of 'od' is to provide tools and example datasets for working with origin-destination
    ('OD') datasets of the type used to describe aggregate urban mobility patterns (Carey
    et al. 1981) <doi:10.1287/trsc.15.1.32>. The package builds on functions for working
    with 'OD' data in the package 'stplanr', (Lovelace and Ellison 2018) <doi:10.32614/RJ-2018-053>
    with a focus on computational efficiency and support for  the 'sf' class system
    (Pebesma 2018) <doi:10.32614/RJ-2018-009>. With few dependencies and a simple class
    system based on data frames, the package is intended to facilitate efficient analysis
    of 'OD' datasets and to provide a place for developing new functions. The package
    enables the creation and analysis of geographic entities representing large scale
    mobility patterns, from daily travel between zones in cities to migration between
    countries.
