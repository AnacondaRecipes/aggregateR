  summary: 'Implementation of both the exact and approximation methods for computing the cdf
    of the Poisson binomial distribution as described in Hong (2013) <doi: 10.1016/j.csda.2012.10.006>.
    It also provides the pmf, quantile function, and random number generation for the
    Poisson binomial distribution. The C code for fast Fourier transformation (FFT)
    is written by R Core Team (2019)<https://www.R-project.org/>, which implements the
    FFT algorithm in Singleton (1969) <doi: 10.1109/TAU.1969.1162042>.'
