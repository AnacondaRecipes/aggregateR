  summary: A fast implementation with additional experimental features for testing, monitoring
    and dating structural changes in (linear) regression models. 'strucchangeRcpp' features
    tests/methods from the generalized fluctuation test framework as well as from the
    F test (Chow test) framework. This includes methods to fit, plot and test fluctuation
    processes (e.g. cumulative/moving sum, recursive/moving estimates) and F statistics,
    respectively. These methods are described in Zeileis et al. (2002) <doi:10.18637/jss.v007.i02>.
    Finally, the breakpoints in regression models with structural changes can be estimated
    together with confidence intervals, and their magnitude as well as the model fit
    can be evaluated using a variety of statistical measures.
