  summary: Computes proximity between rows or columns of large matrices efficiently in C++. Functions
    are optimised for large sparse matrices using the Armadillo and Intel TBB libraries.
    Among several built-in similarity/distance measures, computation of correlation,
    cosine similarity and Euclidean distance is particularly fast.
