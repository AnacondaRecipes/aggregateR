  summary: Computationally efficient tools for fitting generalized linear model with convex or
    non-convex penalty. Users can enjoy the superior statistical property of non-convex
    penalty such as SCAD and MCP which has significantly less estimation error and overfitting
    compared to convex penalty such as lasso and ridge. Computation is handled by multi-stage
    convex relaxation and the PathwIse CAlibrated Sparse Shooting algOrithm (PICASSO)
    which exploits warm start initialization, active set updating, and strong rule for
    coordinate preselection to boost computation, and attains a linear convergence to
    a unique sparse local optimum with optimal statistical properties. The computation
    is memory-optimized using the sparse matrix output.
