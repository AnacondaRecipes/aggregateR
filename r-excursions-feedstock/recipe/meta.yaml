  summary: Functions that compute probabilistic excursion sets, contour credibility regions,
    contour avoiding regions, and simultaneous confidence bands for latent Gaussian
    random processes and fields. The package also contains functions that calculate
    these quantities for models estimated with the INLA package. The main references
    for excursions are Bolin and Lindgren (2015) <doi:10.1111/rssb.12055>, Bolin and
    Lindgren (2017) <doi:10.1080/10618600.2016.1228537>, and Bolin and Lindgren (2018)
    <doi:10.18637/jss.v086.i05>. These can be generated by the citation function in
    R.
