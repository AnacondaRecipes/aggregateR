  summary: Provides an R interface to all 'Enrichr' databases. 'Enrichr' is a web-based tool
    for analysing gene sets and returns any enrichment of common annotated biological
    features. Quoting from their website 'Enrichment analysis is a computational method
    for inferring knowledge about an input gene set by comparing it to annotated gene
    sets representing prior biological knowledge.' See (<http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/>)
