  summary: Random number generation for the truncated multivariate normal and Student t distribution.
    Computes probabilities, quantiles and densities, including one-dimensional and bivariate
    marginal densities. Computes first and second moments (i.e. mean and covariance
    matrix) for the double-truncated multinormal case.
