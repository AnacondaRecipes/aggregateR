  summary: 'Performs regression analysis for longitudinal count data, allowing for serial dependence
    among observations from a given individual and two dimensional random effects on
    the linear predictor. Estimation is via maximization of the exact likelihood of
    a suitably defined model. Missing values and unbalanced data are allowed. Details
