  summary: Allows practitioners and researchers a wholesale approach for deriving magnitude-based
    inferences from raw data. A major goal of 'mbir' is to programmatically detect appropriate
    statistical tests to run in lieu of relying on practitioners to determine correct
    stepwise procedures independently.
