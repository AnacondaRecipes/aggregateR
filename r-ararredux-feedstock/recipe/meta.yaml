  summary: Processes noble gas mass spectrometer data to determine the isotopic composition of
    argon (comprised of Ar36, Ar37, Ar38, Ar39 and Ar40) released from neutron-irradiated
    potassium-bearing minerals. Then uses these compositions to calculate precise and
    accurate geochronological ages for multiple samples as well as the covariances between
    them. Error propagation is done in matrix form, which jointly treats all samples
    and all isotopes simultaneously at every step of the data reduction process. Includes
    methods for regression of the time-resolved mass spectrometer signals to t=0 ('time
    zero') for both single- and multi-collector instruments, blank correction, mass
    fractionation correction, detector intercalibration, decay corrections, interference
    corrections, interpolation of the irradiation parameter between neutron fluence
    monitors, and (weighted mean) age calculation. All operations are performed on the
    logs of the ratios between the different argon isotopes so as to properly treat
    them as 'compositional data', sensu Aitchison [1986, The Statistics of Compositional
    Data, Chapman and Hall].
