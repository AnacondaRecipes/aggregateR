  summary: Provides wrapper of various machine learning models. In applied machine learning,
    there is a strong belief that we need to strike a balance between interpretability
    and accuracy. However, in field of the interpretable machine learning, there are
    more and more new ideas for explaining black-box models, that are implemented in
    'R'. 'DALEXtra' creates 'DALEX' Biecek (2018) <arXiv:1806.08915> explainer for many
    type of models including those created using 'python' 'scikit-learn' and 'keras'
    libraries, and 'java' 'h2o' library. Important part of the package is Champion-Challenger
    analysis and innovative approach to model performance across subsets of test data
    presented in Funnel Plot.
