  summary: Analyses response times and accuracies from psychological experiments with the linear
    ballistic accumulator (LBA) model from Brown and Heathcote (2008). The LBA model
    is optionally fitted with explanatory variables on the parameters such as the drift
    rate, the boundary and the starting point parameters. A log-link function on the
    linear predictors can be used to ensure that parameters remain positive when needed.
