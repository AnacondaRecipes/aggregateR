  summary: A probability tree allows to compute probabilities of complex events, such as genotype
    probabilities in intermediate generations of inbreeding through recurrent self-fertilization
    (selfing). This package implements functionality to compute probability trees for
    two- and three-marker genotypes in the F2 to F7 selfing generations. The conditional
    probabilities are derived automatically and in symbolic form. The package also provides
    functionality to extract and evaluate the relevant probabilities.
