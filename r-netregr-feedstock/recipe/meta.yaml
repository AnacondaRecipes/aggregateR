  summary: Regress network responses (both directed and undirected) onto covariates of interest
    that may be actor-, relation-, or network-valued. In addition, compute principled
    variance estimates of the coefficients assuming that the errors are jointly exchangeable.
    Missing data is accommodated. Additionally implements building and inversion of
    covariance matrices under joint exchangeability, and  generates random covariance
    matrices from this class. For more detail on methods, see Marrs, Fosdick, and McCormick
    (2017) <arXiv:1701.05530>.
