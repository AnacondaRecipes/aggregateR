  summary: For high-dimensional data whose main feature is a large number, p, of variables but
    a small sample size, the null hypothesis that the marginal distributions of p variables
    are the same for two groups is tested. We propose a test statistic motivated by
    the simple idea of comparing, for each of the p variables, the empirical characteristic
    functions computed from the two samples. If one rejects this global null hypothesis
    of no differences in distributions between the two groups, a set of permutation
    p-values is reported to identify which variables are not equally distributed in
    both groups.
