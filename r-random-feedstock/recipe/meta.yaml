  summary: The true random number service provided by the RANDOM.ORG website created by Mads
    Haahr samples atmospheric noise via radio tuned to an unused broadcasting frequency
    together with a skew correction algorithm due to John von Neumann.  More background
    is available in the included vignette based on an essay by Mads Haahr.  In its current
    form, the package offers functions to retrieve random integers, randomized sequences
    and random strings.
