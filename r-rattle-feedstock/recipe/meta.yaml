  summary: The R Analytic Tool To Learn Easily (Rattle) provides a collection of utilities functions
    for the data scientist. A Gnome (RGtk2) based graphical interface is included with
    the aim to provide a simple and intuitive introduction to R for data science, allowing
    a user to quickly load data from a CSV file (or via ODBC), transform and explore
    the data, build and evaluate models, and export models as PMML (predictive modelling
    markup language) or as scores. A key aspect of the GUI is that all R commands are
    logged and commented through the log tab. This can be saved as a standalone R script
    file and as an aid for the user to learn R or to copy-and-paste directly into R
    itself. Note that RGtk2 and cairoDevice have been archived on CRAN. See <https://rattle.togaware.com>
    for installation instructions.
