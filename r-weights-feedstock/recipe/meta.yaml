  summary: 'Provides a variety of functions for producing simple weighted statistics, such as
    weighted Pearson''s correlations, partial correlations, Chi-Squared statistics,
    histograms, and t-tests.  Also now includes some software for quickly recoding survey
    data and plotting estimates from interaction terms in regressions (and multiply
    imputed regressions) both with and without weights. NOTE: Weighted partial correlation
    calculations pulled to address a bug.'
