  summary: An implementation of the RuleFit algorithm as described in Friedman & Popescu (2008)
    <doi:10.1214/07-AOAS148>. eXtreme Gradient Boosting ('XGBoost') is used to build
    rules, and 'glmnet' is used to fit a sparse linear model on the raw and rule features.
    The result is a model that learns similarly to a tree ensemble, while often offering
    improved interpretability and achieving improved scoring runtime in live applications.
    Several algorithms for reducing rule complexity are provided, most notably hyperrectangle
    de-overlapping. All algorithms scale to several million rows and support sparse
    representations to handle tens of thousands of dimensions.
