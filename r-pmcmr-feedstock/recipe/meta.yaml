  summary: Note, that the 'PMCMR' package is superset by the novel 'PMCMRplus' package. The 'PMCMRplus'
    package contains all functions from 'PMCMR' and many more parametric and non-parametric
    multiple comparison procedures, one-factorial trend tests, as well as improved method
    functions, such as print, summary and plot. The 'PMCMR' package is no longer maintained,
    but kept for compatibility of reverse depending packages for some time.
