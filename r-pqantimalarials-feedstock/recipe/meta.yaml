  summary: 'This package allows users to calculate the number of under-five child deaths caused
    by consumption of poor quality antimalarials across 39 sub-Saharan nations. The
    package supports one function, that starts an interactive web tool created using
    the shiny R package. The web tool runs locally on the user''s machine. The web tool
    allows users to set input parameters (prevalence of poor quality antimalarials,
    case fatality rate of children who take poor quality antimalarials, and sample size)
    which are then used to perform an uncertainty analysis following the Latin hypercube
    sampling scheme. Users can download the output figures as PDFs, and the output data
    as CSVs. Users can also download their input parameters for reference. This package
    was designed to accompany the analysis presented in: J. Patrick Renschler, Kelsey
    Walters, Paul Newton, Ramanan Laxminarayan "Estimated under-five deaths associated
    with poor-quality antimalarials in sub-Saharan Africa", 2014. Paper submitted.'
