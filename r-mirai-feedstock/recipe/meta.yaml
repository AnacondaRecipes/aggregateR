  summary: Lightweight parallel code execution and distributed computing. Designed for simplicity,
    a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression asynchronously, on local or network resources,
    resolving automatically upon completion. Features efficient task scheduling, fast
    inter-process communications, and Transport Layer Security over TCP/IP for remote
    connections, courtesy of 'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Gen).
