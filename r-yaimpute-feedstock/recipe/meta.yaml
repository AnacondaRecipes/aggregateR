  summary: 'Performs nearest neighbor-based imputation using one or more alternative approaches
    to processing multivariate data. These include methods based on canonical correlation:
    analysis, canonical correspondence analysis, and a multivariate adaptation of the
    random forest classification and regression techniques of Leo Breiman and Adele
    Cutler. Additional methods are also offered. The package includes functions for
    comparing the results from running alternative techniques, detecting imputation
    targets that are notably distant from reference observations, detecting and correcting
    for bias, bootstrapping and building ensemble imputations, and mapping results.'
