  summary: Supports concordances in 'R Markdown' documents.  This currently allows the original
    source location in the '.Rmd' file of errors detected by 'HTML tidy' to be found
    more easily, and potentially allows forward and reverse search in 'HTML' and 'LaTeX'
    documents produced from 'R Markdown'.  The 'LaTeX' support has been included in
    the most recent development version of the 'patchDVI' package.
