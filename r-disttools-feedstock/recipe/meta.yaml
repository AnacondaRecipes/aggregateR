  summary: Provides convenient methods for accessing the data in 'dist' objects with minimal
    memory and computational overhead. 'disttools' can be used to extract the distance
    between any pair or combination of points encoded by a 'dist' object using only
    the indices of those points. This is an improvement over existing functionality,
    which requires either coercing a 'dist' object into a matrix or calculating the
    one dimensional index corresponding to a pair of observations. Coercion to a matrix
    is undesirable because doing so doubles the amount of memory required for storage.
    In contrast, there is no inherent downside to the latter solution. However, in part
    due to several edge cases, correctly and efficiently implementing such a solution
    can be challenging. 'disttools' abstracts away these challenges and provides a simple
    interface to access the data in a 'dist' object using the latter approach.
