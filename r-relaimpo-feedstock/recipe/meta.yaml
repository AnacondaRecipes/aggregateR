  summary: Provides several metrics for assessing relative importance in linear models. These
    can be printed, plotted and bootstrapped. The recommended metric is lmg, which provides
    a decomposition of the model explained variance into non-negative contributions.
    There is a version of this package available that additionally provides a new and
    also recommended metric called pmvd. If you are a non-US user, you can download
    this extended version from Ulrike Groempings web site.
