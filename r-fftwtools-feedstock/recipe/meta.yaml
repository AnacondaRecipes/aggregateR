  summary: 'Provides a wrapper for several ''FFTW'' functions. This package provides access to
    the two-dimensional ''FFT'', the multivariate ''FFT'', and the one-dimensional real
    to complex ''FFT'' using the ''FFTW3'' library. The package includes the functions
    fftw() and mvfftw() which are designed to mimic the functionality of the R functions
    fft() and mvfft(). The ''FFT'' functions have a parameter that allows them to not
    return the redundant complex conjugate when the input is real data. '
