  summary: Tools to create an interactive web-based visualization of a topic model that has been
    fit to a corpus of text data using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Given the
    estimated parameters of the topic model, it computes various summary statistics
    as input to an interactive visualization built with D3.js that is accessed via a
    browser. The goal is to help users interpret the topics in their LDA topic model.
