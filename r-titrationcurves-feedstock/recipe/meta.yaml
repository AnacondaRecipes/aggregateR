  summary: A collection of functions to plot acid/base titration curves (pH vs. volume of titrant),
    complexation titration curves (pMetal vs. volume of EDTA), redox titration curves
    (potential vs.volume of titrant), and precipitation titration curves (either pAnalyte
    or pTitrant vs. volume of titrant). Options include the titration of mixtures, the
    ability to overlay two or more titration curves, and the ability to show equivalence
    points.
