  summary: Meth27QC is a tool for analyzing Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip Data
    and generating QC reports. This package allows users quickly assess data quality
    of the Assay. Users can evaluate the data quality in the way that Illumina GenomeStudio/BeadStudio
    recommended based on the control probes. The package reads files exported from GenomeStudio/BeadStudio
    software, generating intensity and standard deviation plots grouped by the types
    of the control probes. Meth27 carries 40 control probes for staining, hybridization,
    target removal, extension, bisulfite conversion, specificity, negative and non-polymorphic
    controls. Details of those control probes can be found in the Infinium Assay for
    Methylation Protocol Guide from Illumina.We also used the other non-control probes
    to plot intensity of detected genes, signal average for green and red. Outliers
    can be identified.
