  summary: 'Functions to describe sampling and diversity dynamics of fossil occurrence datasets
    (e.g. from the Paleobiology Database). The package includes methods to calculate
    range- and occurrence-based metrics of taxonomic richness, extinction and origination
    rates, along with traditional sampling measures. A powerful subsampling tool is
    also included that implements frequently used sampling standardization methods in
    a multiple bin-framework. The plotting of time series and the occurrence data can
    be simplified by the functions incorporated in the package, as well other calculations,
    such as environmental affinities and extinction selectivity testing. Details can
    be found in: Kocsis, A.T.; Reddin, C.J.; Alroy, J. and Kiessling, W. (2019) <doi:10.1101/423780>.'
