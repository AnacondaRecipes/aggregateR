  summary: Functions to calculate Unique Trait Combinations (UTC) and scaled Unique Trait Combinations
    (sUTC) as measures of multivariate richness. The package can also calculate beta-diversity
    for trait richness and can partition this into nestedness-related and turnover components.
    The code will also calculate several measures of overlap. See Keyel and Wiegand
    (2016) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12558> for more details.
