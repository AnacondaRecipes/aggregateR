  summary: Fits a constrained regression model for an ordinal response with ordinal predictors
    and possibly others, Espinosa and Hennig (2018) <arXiv:1804.08715>. The parameter
    estimates associated with an ordinal predictor are constrained to be monotonic.
    If a monotonicity direction (isotonic or antitonic) is not specified for an ordinal
    predictor by the user, then the monotonicity direction classification procedure
    establishes it. A monotonicity test is also available to test the null hypothesis
    of monotonicity over a set of parameters associated with an ordinal predictor.
