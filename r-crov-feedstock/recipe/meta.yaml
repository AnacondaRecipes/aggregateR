  summary: Fits a constrained regression model for an ordinal response with ordinal predictors
    and possibly others, Espinosa and Hennig (2019) <doi:10.1007/s11222-018-9842-2>.
    The parameter estimates associated with an ordinal predictor are constrained to
    be monotonic. If a monotonicity direction (isotonic or antitonic) is not specified
    for an ordinal predictor by the user, then the monotonicity direction classification
    procedure establishes it. Two monotonicity tests are also available to test the
    null hypothesis of monotonicity over a set of parameters associated with an ordinal
    predictor.
