  summary: Fits a constrained regression model for an ordinal response with ordinal predictors
    and possibly others, Espinosa and Hennig (2019) <DOI:10.1007/s11222-018-9842-2>.
    The parameter estimates associated with an ordinal predictor are constrained to
    be monotonic. If a monotonicity direction (isotonic or antitonic) is not specified
    for an ordinal predictor by the user, then one of the available methods will either
    establish it or drop the monotonicity assumption. Two monotonicity tests are also
    available to test the null hypothesis of monotonicity over a set of parameters associated
    with an ordinal predictor.
