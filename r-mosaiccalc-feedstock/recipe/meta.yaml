  summary: Software to support the introductory *MOSAIC Calculus* textbook <https://www.mosaic-web.org/MOSAIC-Calculus/>),
    one of many data- and modeling-oriented educational resources developed by Project
    MOSAIC (<https://www.mosaic-web.org/>). Provides symbolic and numerical differentiation
    and integration, as well as support for applied linear algebra (for data science),
    and differential equations/dynamics. Includes grammar-of-graphics-based functions
    for drawing vector fields, trajectories, etc. The software is suitable for general
    use, but intended mainly for teaching calculus.
