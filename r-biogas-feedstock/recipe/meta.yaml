  summary: High- and low-level functions for processing biogas data and predicting biogas production.
    Molar mass and calculated oxygen demand (COD') can be determined from a chemical
    formula. Measured gas volume can be corrected for water vapor and to (possibly user-defined)
    standard temperature and pressure. Gas quantity can be converted between volume,
    mass, and moles. Gas composition, cumulative production, or other variables can
    be interpolated to a specified time. Cumulative biogas and methane production (and
    rates) can be calculated using volumetric, manometric, or gravimetric methods for
    any number of reactors. With cumulative methane production data and data on reactor
    contents, biochemical methane potential (BMP) can be calculated and summarized,
    including subtraction of the inoculum contribution and normalization by substrate
    mass. Cumulative production and production rates can be summarized in several different
    ways (e.g., omitting normalization) using the same function. Biogas quantity and
    composition can be predicted from substrate composition and additional, optional
    data. Lastly, inoculum and substrate mass can be determined for planning BMP experiments.
