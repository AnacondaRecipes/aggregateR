  summary: The SHIP-package allows the estimation of various types of shrinkage covariance matrices.
    These types differ in terms of the so-called covariance target (to be chosen by
    the user), the highly structured matrix which the standard unbiased sample covariance
    matrix is shrunken towards and which optionally incorporates prior biological knowledge
    extracted from the database KEGG. The shrinkage intensity is obtained via an analytical
    procedure.
