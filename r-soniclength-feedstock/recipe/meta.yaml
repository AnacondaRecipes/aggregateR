  summary: Estimate the abundance of cell clones from the distribution of lengths of DNA fragments
    (as created by sonication, whence `sonicLength').  The algorithm in "Estimating
    abundances of retroviral insertion sites from DNA fragment length data" by Berry
    CC, Gillet NA, Melamed A, Gormley N, Bangham CR, Bushman FD. Bioinformatics; 2012
    Mar 15;28(6):755-62 is implemented.  The experimental setting and estimation details
    are described in detail there. Briefly, integration of new DNA in a host genome
    (due to retroviral infection or gene therapy) can be tracked using DNA sequencing,
    potentially allowing characterization of the abundance of individual cell clones
    bearing distinct integration sites. The locations of integration sites can be determined
    by fragmenting the host DNA (via sonication or fragmentase), breaking the newly
    integrated DNA at a known sequence, amplifying the fragments containing both host
    and integrated DNA, sequencing those amplicons, then mapping the host sequences
    to positions on the reference genome. The relative number of fragments containing
    a given position in the host genome estimates the relative abundance of cells hosting
    the corresponding integration site, but that number is not available and the count
    of amplicons per fragment varies widely.  However, the expected number of distinct
    fragment lengths is a function of the abundance of cells hosting an integration
    site at a given position and a certain nuisance parameter. The algorithm implicitly
    estimates that function to estimate the relative abundance.
