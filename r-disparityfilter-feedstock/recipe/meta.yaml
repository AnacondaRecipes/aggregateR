  summary: The disparity filter algorithm is a network reduction technique to identify the 'backbone'
    structure of a weighted network without destroying its multi-scale nature. The algorithm
    is documented in M. Angeles Serrano, Marian Boguna and Alessandro Vespignani in
    "Extracting the multiscale backbone of complex weighted networks", Proceedings of
    the National Academy of Sciences 106 (16), 2009. This implementation of the algorithm
    supports both directed and undirected networks.
