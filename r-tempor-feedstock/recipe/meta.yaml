  summary: TEMPO (TEmporal Modeling of Pathway Outliers) is a pathway-based outlier detection
    approach for finding pathways showing  significant changes in temporal expression
    patterns across conditions.  Given a gene expression data set where each sample
    is characterized by  an age or time point as well as a phenotype (e.g. control or
    disease), and a collection of gene sets or pathways, TEMPO ranks each pathway by
    a score that characterizes how well a partial least squares regression (PLSR) model
    can predict age as a function of gene expression in the controls and how poorly
    that same model performs in the disease. TEMPO v1.0.3 is described in Pietras (2018)
    <doi:10.1145/3233547.3233559>.
