  summary: Implementation of a Metropolis-within-Gibbs MCMC algorithm to flexibly estimate the
    spectral density of a stationary time series.  The algorithm updates a nonparametric
    B-spline prior using the Whittle likelihood to produce pseudo-posterior samples
    and is based on the work presented in Edwards, M.C., Meyer, R. and Christensen,
    N., Statistics and Computing (2018). <doi.org/10.1007/s11222-017-9796-9>.
