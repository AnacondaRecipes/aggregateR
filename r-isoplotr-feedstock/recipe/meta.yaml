  summary: Plots U-Pb data on Wetherill and Tera-Wasserburg concordia diagrams. Calculates concordia
    and discordia ages. Performs linear regression of measurements with correlated errors
    using 'York', 'Titterington', 'Ludwig' and Omnivariant Generalised Least-Squares
    ('OGLS') approaches. Generates Kernel Density Estimates (KDEs) and Cumulative Age
    Distributions (CADs). Produces Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) configurations and
    Shepard plots of multi-sample detrital datasets using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance
    as a dissimilarity measure. Calculates 40Ar/39Ar ages, isochrons, and age spectra.
    Computes weighted means accounting for overdispersion. Calculates U-Th-He (single
    grain and central) ages, logratio plots and ternary diagrams. Processes fission
    track data using the external detector method and LA-ICP-MS, calculates central
    ages and plots fission track and other data on radial (a.k.a. 'Galbraith') plots.
    Constructs total Pb-U, Pb-Pb, Th-Pb, K-Ca, Re-Os, Sm-Nd, Lu-Hf, Rb-Sr and 230Th-U
    isochrons as well as 230Th-U evolution plots.
