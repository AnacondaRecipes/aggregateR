  summary: Automatically stores objects in files on disk so that files are rewritten when objects
    are changed, and so that objects are accessible but do not occupy memory until they
    are accessed. Keeps track of times when objects are created and modified, and caches
    some basic characteristics of objects to allow for fast summaries of objects.  Also
    provides a command history mechanism that saves the last command to a history file
    after each command completes.
