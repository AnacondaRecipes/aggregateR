  summary: 'Computes the areas under the precision-recall (PR) and ROC curve for weighted (e.g.,
    soft-labeled) and unweighted data. In contrast to other implementations, the interpolation
    between points of the PR curve is done by a non-linear piecewise function. In addition
    to the areas under the curves, the curves themselves can also be computed and plotted
    by a specific S3-method. References: Davis and Goadrich (2006) <doi:10.1145/1143844.1143874>;
