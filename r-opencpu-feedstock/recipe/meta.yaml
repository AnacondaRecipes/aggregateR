  summary: A system for embedded scientific computing and reproducible research with R. The OpenCPU
    server exposes a simple but powerful HTTP api for RPC and data interchange with
    R. This provides a reliable and scalable foundation for statistical services or
    building R web applications. The OpenCPU server runs either as a single-user development
    server within the interactive R session, or as a multi-user Linux stack based on
    Apache2. The entire system is fully open source and permissively licensed. The OpenCPU
    website has detailed documentation and example apps.
