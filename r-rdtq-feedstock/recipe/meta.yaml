  summary: Implementation of density tracking by quadrature (DTQ) algorithms for stochastic differential
    equations (SDEs).  DTQ algorithms numerically compute the density function of the
    solution of an SDE with user-specified drift and diffusion functions.  The calculation
    does not require generation of sample paths, but instead proceeds in a deterministic
    fashion by repeatedly applying quadrature to the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation associated
    with a discrete-time approximation of the SDE.  The DTQ algorithm is provably convergent.  For
    several practical problems of interest, we have found the DTQ algorithm to be fast,
    accurate, and easy to use.
