  summary: The goal of 'pak' is to make package installation faster and more reliable. In particular,
    it performs all HTTP operations in parallel, so metadata resolution and package
    downloads are fast. Metadata and package files are cached on the local disk as well.
    'pak' has a dependency solver, so it finds version conflicts before performing the
    installation. This version of 'pak' supports CRAN, 'Bioconductor' and 'GitHub' packages
    as well.
