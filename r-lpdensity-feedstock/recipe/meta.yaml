  summary: 'Without imposing stringent distributional assumptions or shape restrictions, nonparametric
    estimation has been popular in economics and other social sciences for counterfactual
    analysis, program evaluation, and policy recommendations. This package implements
    a novel density (and derivatives) estimator based on local polynomial regressions,
    documented in Cattaneo, Jansson and Ma (2022) <doi:10.18637/jss.v101.i02>: lpdensity()
    to construct local polynomial based density (and derivatives) estimator, and lpbwdensity()
    to perform data-driven bandwidth selection.'
