  summary: Expands quoted language by recursively replacing any symbol that points to quoted
    language with the language it points to.  The recursive process continues until
    only symbols that point to non-language objects remain.  The resulting quoted language
    can then be evaluated normally.  This differs from the traditional 'quote'/'eval'
    pattern because it resolves intermediate language objects that would interfere with
    evaluation.
