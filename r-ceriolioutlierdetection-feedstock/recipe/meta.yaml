  summary: Implements the iterated RMCD method of Cerioli (2010) for multivariate outlier detection
    via robust Mahalanobis distances. Also provides the finite-sample RMCD method discussed
    in the paper, as well as  the methods provided in Hardin and Rocke (2005) <doi:10.1198/106186005X77685>  and
    Green and Martin (2017).
