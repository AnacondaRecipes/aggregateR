  summary: A simplified, efficient, interface to MPI for HPC clusters. It is a derivation and
    rethinking of the Rmpi package. pbdMPI embraces the prevalent parallel programming
    style on HPC clusters. Beyond the interface, a collection of functions for global
    work with distributed data and resource-independent RNG reproducibility is included.
    It is based on S4 classes and methods.
