  summary: Computes the Conover-Iman test (1979) for stochastic dominance and reports the results
    among multiple pairwise comparisons after a Kruskal-Wallis test for stochastic dominance
    among k groups (Kruskal and Wallis, 1952). The interpretation of stochastic dominance
    requires an assumption that the CDF of one group does not cross the CDF of the other.
    conover.test makes k(k-1)/2 multiple pairwise comparisons based on Conover-Iman
    t-test-statistic of the rank differences. The null hypothesis for each pairwise
    comparison is that the probability of observing a randomly selected value from the
    first group that is larger than a randomly selected value from the second group
    equals one half; this null hypothesis corresponds to that of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney
    rank-sum test. Like the rank-sum test, if the data can be assumed to be continuous,
    and the distributions are assumed identical except for a difference in location,
    Conover-Iman test may be understood as a test for median difference. conover.test
    accounts for tied ranks. The Conover-Iman test is strictly valid if and only if
    the corresponding Kruskal-Wallis null hypothesis is rejected.
