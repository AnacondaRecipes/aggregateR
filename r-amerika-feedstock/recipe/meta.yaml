  summary: A color palette generator inspired by American politics, with colors ranging from
    blue on the  left to gray in the middle and red on the right. A variety of palettes
    allow for a range of applications  from brief discrete scales (e.g., three colors
    for Democrats, Independents, and Republicans) to  continuous interpolated arrays
    including dozens of shades graded from blue (left) to red (right). This package
    greatly benefitted from building on the source code (with permission) from Ram and
    Wickham (2015).
