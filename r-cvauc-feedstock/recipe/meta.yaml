  summary: Tools for working with and evaluating cross-validated area under the ROC curve (AUC)
    estimators.  The primary functions of the package are ci.cvAUC and ci.pooled.cvAUC,
    which report cross-validated AUC and compute confidence intervals for cross-validated
    AUC estimates based on influence curves for i.i.d. and pooled repeated measures
    data, respectively.  One benefit to using influence curve based confidence intervals
    is that they require much less computation time than bootstrapping methods.  The
    utility functions, AUC and cvAUC, are simple wrappers for functions from the ROCR
    package.
