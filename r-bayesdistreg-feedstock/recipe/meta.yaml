  summary: Implements Bayesian Distribution Regression methods. This package contains functions
    for three estimators (non-asymptotic, semi-asymptotic and asymptotic) and related
    routines for Bayesian Distribution Regression in Huang and Tsyawo (2018) <doi:10.2139/ssrn.3048658>
    which is also the recommended reference to cite for this package. The functions
    can be grouped into three (3) categories. The first computes the logit likelihood
    function and posterior densities under uniform and normal priors. The second contains
    Independence and Random Walk Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
    algorithms as functions and the third category of functions are useful for semi-asymptotic
    and asymptotic Bayesian distribution regression inference.
