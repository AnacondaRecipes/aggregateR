  summary: Provides a set of streamlined functions that allow easy generation of linear regression
    diagnostic plots necessarily for checking linear model assumptions. This package
    is meant for easy scheming of linear regression diagnostics, while preserving merits
    of "The Grammar of Graphics" as implemented in 'ggplot2'. See the 'ggplot2' website
    for more information regarding the specific capability of graphics.
