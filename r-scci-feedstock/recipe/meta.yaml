  summary: An efficient implementation of SCCI using 'Rcpp'. SCCI is short for the Stochastic
    Complexity-based Conditional Independence criterium (Marx and Vreeken, 2019). SCCI
    is an asymptotically unbiased and L2 consistent estimator of (conditional) mutual
    information for discrete data.
