  summary: 'Performs two-sample comparisons using the restricted mean survival time (RMST) as
    a summary measure of the survival time distribution. Three kinds of between-group
    contrast metrics (i.e., the difference in RMST, the ratio of RMST and the ratio
    of the restricted mean time lost (RMTL)) are computed. It performs an ANCOVA-type
    covariate adjustment as well as unadjusted analyses for those measures. '
