  summary: 'An implementation of the TrueSkill algorithm (Herbrich, R., Minka, T. and Grapel,
    T) in R; a Bayesian skill rating system with inference by approximate message passing
    on a factor graph. Used by Xbox to rank gamers and identify appropriate matches.
    http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/trueskill/default.aspx Current version
    allows for one player per team. Will update as time permits.  Requires R version
    3.0 as it is written with Reference Classes.  URL: https://github.com/bhoung/trueskill-in-r
    Acknowledgements to Doug Zongker and Heungsub Lee for their python implementations
    of the algorithm and for the liberal reuse of Doug''s code comments (@dougz and
