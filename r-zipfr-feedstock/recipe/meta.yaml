  summary: Statistical models and utilities for the analysis of word frequency distributions.
    The utilities include functions for loading, manipulating and visualizing word frequency
    data and vocabulary growth curves.  The package also implements several statistical  models
    for the distribution of word frequencies in a population.  (The name of this package  derives
    from the most famous word frequency distribution, Zipf's law.)
