  summary: 'This package contains functions to calculate the Specificity Index statistic, which
    can be used for comparative quantitative analysis to identify genes enriched in
    specific cell populations across a large number of profiles, as well as perform
    numerous post-processing operations. NOTE:Supplementary data (human & mouse expression
    sets, calculated pSI datasets, etc.) can be found in pSI.data package located at
