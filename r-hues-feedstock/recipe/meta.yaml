  summary: Creating effective colour palettes for figures is  challenging. This package generates
    and plot palettes of optimally  distinct colours in perceptually uniform colour
    space, based on  'iwanthue' <http://tools.medialab.sciences-po.fr/iwanthue/>.  This
    is done through k-means clustering of CIE Lab colour space,  according to user-selected
    constraints on hue, chroma, and  lightness.
