  summary: 'Several dozen low-level utilities and codes from the Interactive Data Language (IDL)
    Astronomy Users Library (http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov) are implemented in R.  They
    treat: time, coordinate and proper motion transformations; terrestrial precession
    and nutation, atmospheric refraction and aberration, barycentric corrections, and
    related effects; utilities for astrometry, photometry, and spectroscopy; and utilities
    for planetary, stellar, Galactic, and extragalactic science.'
