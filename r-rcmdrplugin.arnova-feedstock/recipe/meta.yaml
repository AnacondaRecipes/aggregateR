  summary: R Commander plug-in for repeated-measures and mixed-design ('split-plot') ANOVA. It
    adds a new menu entry for repeated measures that allows to deal with up to three
    within-subject factors and optionally with one or several between-subject factors.
    It also provides supplementary options to oneWayAnova() and multiWayAnova() functions,
    such as choice of ANOVA type, display of effect sizes and post hoc analysis for
    multiWayAnova().
