  summary: Data sets for isotope pattern grouping of LC-HRMS peaks with package nontarget. Based
    on a vast set of unique PubChem molecular formulas, quantized (a) m/z, (b) m/z differences,
    (c) intensity ratios and (d) marker centroids of simulated centroid pairs are listed
    for different instrument resolutions.
