  summary: Given a regression model, segmented `updates' it by adding one or more segmented (i.e.,
    piece-wise linear) relationships. Several variables with multiple breakpoints are
    allowed. The estimation method is discussed in Muggeo (2003, <doi:10.1002/sim.1545>)
    and illustrated in Muggeo (2008, <https://www.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2008-1.pdf>).
    An approach for hypothesis testing is presented in Muggeo (2016, <doi:10.1080/00949655.2016.1149855>),
    and interval estimation for the breakpoint is discussed in Muggeo (2017, <doi:10.1111/anzs.12200>).
    Segmented mixed models, i.e. random effects in the change point, are discussed in
    in Muggeo (2014, <doi:10.1177/1471082X13504721>).
