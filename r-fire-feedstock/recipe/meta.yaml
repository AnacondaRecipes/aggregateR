  summary: 'The algorithm assigns rareness/ outlierness score to every sample in voluminous datasets.
    The algorithm makes multiple estimations of the proximity between a pair of samples,
    in low-dimensional spaces. To compute proximity, FiRE uses Sketching, a variant
    of locality sensitive hashing. For more details: Jindal, A., Gupta, P., Jayadeva
    and Sengupta, D., 2018. Discovery of rare cells from voluminous single cell expression
    data. Nature Communications, 9(1), p.4719. <doi:10.1038/s41467-018-07234-6>.'
