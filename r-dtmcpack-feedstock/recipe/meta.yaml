  summary: A series of functions which aid in both simulating and determining the properties
    of finite, discrete-time, discrete state markov chains.  Two functions (DTMC, MultDTMC)
    produce n iterations of a Markov Chain(s)  based on transition probabilities and
    an initial distribution.  The function FPTime determines the first passage time
    into each state.  The function statdistr determines the stationary distribution
    of a Markov Chain.
