  summary: Estimating mutation and selection coefficients on synonymous codon bias usage based
    on models of ribosome overhead cost (ROC). Multinomial logistic regression and Markov
    Chain Monte Carlo are used to estimate and predict protein production rates with/without
    the presence of expressions and measurement errors. Work flows with examples for
    simulation, estimation and prediction processes are also provided with parallelization
    speedup. The whole framework is tested with yeast genome and gene expression data
    of Yassour, et al. (2009) <doi:10.1073/pnas.0812841106>.
