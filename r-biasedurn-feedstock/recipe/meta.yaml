  summary: Statistical models of biased sampling in the form of univariate and multivariate noncentral
    hypergeometric distributions, including Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric distribution
    and Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution (also called extended hypergeometric
    distribution). See vignette("UrnTheory") for explanation of these distributions.
