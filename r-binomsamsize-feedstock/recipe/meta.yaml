  summary: A suite of functions to compute confidence intervals and necessary sample sizes for
    the parameter p of the Bernoulli B(p) distribution under simple random sampling
    or under pooled sampling. Such computations are e.g. of interest when investigating
    the incidence or prevalence in populations. The package contains functions to compute
    coverage probabilities and coverage coefficients of the provided confidence intervals
    procedures. Sample size calculations are based on expected length.
