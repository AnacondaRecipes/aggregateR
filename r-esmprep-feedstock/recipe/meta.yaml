  summary: Support in preparing a raw ESM dataset for statistical analysis. Preparation includes
    the handling of errors (mostly due to technological reasons) and the generating
    of new variables that are necessary and/or helpful in meeting the conditions when
    statistically analyzing ESM data. The functions in 'esmprep' are meant to hierarchically
    lead from bottom, i.e. the raw (separated) ESM dataset(s), to top, i.e. a single
    ESM dataset ready for statistical analysis. This hierarchy evolved out of my personal
    experience in working with ESM data.
