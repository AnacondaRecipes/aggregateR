  summary: Heller-Heller-Gorfine tests are a set of powerful statistical tests of multivariate
    k-sample homogeneity and independence (Heller et. al., 2013, <doi:10.1093/biomet/ass070>).
    For the univariate case, the package also offers implementations of the 'MinP DDP'
    and 'MinP ADP' tests by Heller et. al. (2016), which are consistent against all
    continuous alternatives but are distribution-free, and are thus much faster to apply.
