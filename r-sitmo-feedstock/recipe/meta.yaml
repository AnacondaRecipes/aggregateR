  summary: Provided within are two high quality and fast PPRNGs that may be used in an 'OpenMP'
    parallel environment. In addition, there is a generator for one dimensional low-discrepancy
    sequence. The objective of this library to consolidate the distribution of the 'sitmo'
    (C++98 & C++11), 'threefry' and 'vandercorput' (C++11-only) engines on CRAN by enabling
    others to link to the header files inside of 'sitmo' instead of including a copy
    of each engine within their individual package. Lastly, the package contains example
    implementations using the 'sitmo' package and three accompanying vignette that provide
    additional information.
