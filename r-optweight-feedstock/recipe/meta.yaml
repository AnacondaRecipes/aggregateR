  summary: Use optimization to estimate weights that balance covariates for binary, multinomial,
    and continuous treatments in the spirit of Zubizarreta (2015) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2015.1023805>.
    The degree of balance can be specified for each covariate. In addition, sampling
    weights can be estimated that allow a sample to generalize to a population specified
    with given target moments of covariates.
