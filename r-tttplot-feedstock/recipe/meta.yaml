  summary: Implementation of Time to Target plot based on the work of Ribeiro and Rosseti (2015)
    <DOI:10.1007/s11590-014-0760-8>, that describe a numerical method that gives the
    probability of an algorithm A finds a solution at least as good as a given target
    value in smaller computation time than algorithm B.
