  summary: Functions for computing and visualizing generalized canonical discriminant analyses
    and canonical correlation analysis for a multivariate linear model. Traditional
    canonical discriminant analysis is restricted to a one-way 'MANOVA' design and is
    equivalent to canonical correlation analysis between a set of quantitative response
    variables and a set of dummy variables coded from the factor variable. The 'candisc'
    package generalizes this to higher-way 'MANOVA' designs for all factors in a multivariate
    linear model, computing canonical scores and vectors for each term. The graphic
    functions provide low-rank (1D, 2D, 3D) visualizations of terms in an 'mlm' via
    the 'plot.candisc' and 'heplot.candisc' methods. Related plots are now provided
    for canonical correlation analysis when all predictors are quantitative.
