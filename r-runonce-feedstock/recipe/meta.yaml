  summary: Package 'runonce' helps automating the saving of long-running code to help running
    the same code multiple times. If you run some long-running code once, it saves the
    result in a file on disk. Then, if the result already exists, i.e. if the code has
    already been run and its output has already been saved, it just reads the result
    from the stored file instead of running the code again.
