  summary: Tools for estimate (joint) cumulants and (joint) products of cumulants of a random
    sample using (multivariate) k-statistics and (multivariate) polykays, unbiased estimators
    with minimum variance. Tools for generating univariate and multivariate Faa di Bruno's
    formula and related polynomials, such as Bell polynomials, generalized complete
    Bell polynomials, partition polynomials and generalized partition polynomials. For
    more details see Di Nardo E., Guarino G., Senato D. (2009) <arXiv:0807.5008>, <arXiv:1012.6008>.
