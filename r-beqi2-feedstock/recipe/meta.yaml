  summary: 'Tool for analysing benthos data. It estimates several quality  indices like the total
    abundance of species, species richness,  Margalef''s d, AZTI Marine Biotic Index
    (AMBI), and the BEQI-2 index.  Furthermore, additional (optional) features are provided
    that enhance data  preprocessing: (1) genus to species conversion, i.e.,taxa counts
    at the  taxonomic genus level can optionally be converted to the species level and
    (2) pooling: small samples are combined to bigger samples with a  standardized size
    to (a) meet the data requirements of the AMBI,  (b) generate comparable species
    richness values and  (c) give a higher benthos signal to noise ratio.'
