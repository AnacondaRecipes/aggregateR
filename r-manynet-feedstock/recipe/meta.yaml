  summary: A set of tools for making, manipulating, and mapping many different types of networks.
    All functions operate with matrices, edge lists, and 'igraph', 'network', and 'tidygraph'
    objects, and on one-mode, two-mode (bipartite), and sometimes three-mode networks.
    The package includes functions for importing and exporting, creating and generating
    networks, molding and manipulating networks and node and tie attributes, and describing
    and visualizing networks with sensible defaults.
