  summary: 'Implements the following approaches for multidimensional scaling (MDS) based on stress
    minimization using majorization (smacof): ratio/interval/ordinal/spline MDS on symmetric
    dissimilarity matrices, MDS with external constraints on the configuration, individual
    differences scaling (idioscal, indscal), MDS with spherical restrictions, and ratio/interval/ordinal/spline
    unfolding (circular restrictions, row-conditional). Various tools and extensions
    like jackknife MDS, bootstrap MDS, permutation tests, MDS biplots, gravity models,
    unidimensional scaling, drift vectors (asymmetric MDS), classical scaling, and Procrustes
    are implemented as well.'
