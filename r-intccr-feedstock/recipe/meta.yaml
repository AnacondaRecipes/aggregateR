  summary: Semiparametric regression models on the cumulative incidence function for interval-censored
    competing risks data as described in Bakoyannis, Yu, & Yiannoutsos (2017) /doi{10.1002/sim.7350}
    and the models with missing event types as described in Park, Bakoyannis, Zhang,
    & Yiannoutsos (2021) \doi{10.1093/biostatistics/kxaa052}. The proportional subdistribution
    hazards model (Fine-Gray model), the proportional odds model, and other models that
    belong to the class of semiparametric generalized odds rate transformation models.
