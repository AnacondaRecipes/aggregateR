  summary: This code provides a method to fit the hidden compact representation model as well
    as to identify the causal direction on discrete data.  We implement an effective
    solution to recover the above hidden compact representation under the likelihood
    framework.  Please see the Causal Discovery from Discrete Data using Hidden Compact
    Representation from NIPS 2018 by Ruichu Cai, Jie Qiao, Kun Zhang, Zhenjie Zhang
    and Zhifeng Hao (2018) <https://nips.cc/Conferences/2018/Schedule?showEvent=11274>
