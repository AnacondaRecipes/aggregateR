  summary: Estimation of regression models for sparse asynchronous longitudinal observations,
    where time-dependent response and covariates are mismatched and observed intermittently
    within subjects. Kernel weighted estimating equations are used for generalized linear
    models with either time-invariant or time-dependent coefficients.
