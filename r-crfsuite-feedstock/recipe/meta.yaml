  summary: Wraps the 'CRFsuite' library <https://github.com/chokkan/crfsuite> allowing users
    to fit a Conditional Random Field model and to apply it on existing data. The focus
    of the implementation is in the area of Natural Language Processing where this R
    package allows you to easily build and apply models for named entity recognition,
    text chunking, part of speech tagging, intent recognition or classification of any
    category you have in mind. Next to training, a small web application is included
    in the package to allow you to easily construct training data.
