  summary: Tools for the evaluation of interim analysis plans for sequentially monitored trials
    on a survival endpoint; tools to construct efficacy and futility boundaries, for
    deriving power of a sequential design at a specified alternative, template for evaluating
    the performance of candidate plans at a set of time varying alternatives. See Izmirlian,
