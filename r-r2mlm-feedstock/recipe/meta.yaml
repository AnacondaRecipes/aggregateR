  summary: "Generates both total- and level-specific R-squared measures from Rights and Sterba\u2019s
    (2019) <doi:10.1037/met0000184> framework of R-squared measures for multilevel models
    with random intercepts and/or slopes, which is based on a complete decomposition
    of variance. Additionally generates graphical representations of these R-squared
    measures to allow visualizing and interpreting all measures in the framework together
    as an integrated set. This framework subsumes 10 previously-developed R-squared
    measures for multilevel models as special cases of 5 measures from the framework,
    and it also includes several newly-developed measures. Measures in the framework
    can be used to compute R-squared differences when comparing multilevel models (following
    procedures in Rights & Sterba (2020) <doi:10.1080/00273171.2019.1660605>)."
