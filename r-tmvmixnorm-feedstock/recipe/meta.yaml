  summary: 'Efficient sampling of truncated multivariate (scale) mixtures of normals under linear
    inequality constraints is nontrivial due to the analytically intractable normalizing
    constant. Meanwhile, traditional methods may subject to numerical issues, especially
    when the dimension is high and dependence is strong.    Algorithms proposed by Li
    and Ghosh (2015) <doi: 10.1080/15598608.2014.996690> are adopted for overcoming
    difficulties in simulating truncated distributions. Efficient rejection sampling
    for simulating truncated univariate normal distribution is included in the package,
    which shows superiority in terms of acceptance rate and numerical stability compared
    to existing methods and R packages. An efficient function for sampling from truncated
    multivariate normal distribution subject to convex polytope restriction regions
    based on Gibbs sampler for conditional truncated univariate distribution is provided.
    By extending the sampling method, a function for sampling truncated multivariate
    Student''s t distribution is also developed.     Moreover, the proposed method and
    computation remain valid for high dimensional and strong dependence scenarios. Empirical
    results in Li and Ghosh (2015) <doi: 10.1080/15598608.2014.996690> illustrated the
    superior performance in terms of various criteria (e.g. mixing and integrated auto-correlation
    time).'
