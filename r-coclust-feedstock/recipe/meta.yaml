  summary: A copula based clustering algorithm that finds clusters according to the complex multivariate
    dependence structure of the data generating process. The updated version of the
    algorithm is described in Di Lascio, F.M.L. and Giannerini, S. (2016). "Clustering
    dependent observations with copula functions". Statistical Papers, p.1-17. <doi:10.1007/s00362-016-0822-3>.
