  summary: Functions to compute small area estimates based on a basic area or unit-level model.
    The model is fit using restricted maximum likelihood, or in a hierarchical Bayesian
    way. In the latter case numerical integration is used to average over the posterior
    density for the between-area variance.  The output includes the model fit, small
    area estimates and corresponding MSEs, as well as some model selection measures.
    Additional functions provide means to compute aggregate estimates and MSEs, to minimally
    adjust the small area estimates to benchmarks at a higher aggregation level, and
    to graphically compare different sets of small area estimates.
