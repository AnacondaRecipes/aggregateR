  summary: Functions to compute small area estimates based on a basic area or unit-level model.
    The model is fit using restricted maximum likelihood, or in a hierarchical Bayesian
    way. In the latter case numerical integration is used to average over the posterior
    density for the between-area variance. The output includes the model fit, small
    area estimates and corresponding mean squared errors, as well as some model selection
    measures. Additional functions provide means to compute aggregate estimates and
    mean squared errors, to minimally adjust the small area estimates to benchmarks
    at a higher aggregation level, and to graphically compare different sets of small
    area estimates.
