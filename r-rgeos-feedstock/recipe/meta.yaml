  summary: 'Interface to Geometry Engine - Open Source (''GEOS'') using the C ''API'' for topology
    operations on geometries. The ''GEOS'' library is external to the package, and,
    when installing the package from source, must be correctly installed first. Windows
    and Mac Intel OS X binaries are provided on ''CRAN''. (''rgeos'' >= 0.5-1): Up to
    and including ''GEOS'' 3.7.1, topological operations succeeded with some invalid
    geometries for which the same operations fail from and including ''GEOS'' 3.7.2.
    The ''checkValidity='' argument defaults and structure have been changed, from default
    FALSE to integer default ''0L'' for ''GEOS'' < 3.7.2 (no check), ''1L'' ''GEOS''
    >= 3.7.2 (check and warn). A value of ''2L'' is also provided that may be used,
    assigned globally using ''set_RGEOS_CheckValidity(2L)'', or locally using the ''checkValidity=2L''
    argument, to attempt zero-width buffer repair if invalid geometries are found. The
    previous default (FALSE, now ''0L'') is fastest and used for ''GEOS'' < 3.7.2, but
    will not warn users of possible problems before the failure of topological operations
    that previously succeeded.'

# Description: Interface to Geometry Engine - Open Source ('GEOS') using the C 'API' for topology operations on geometries. The 'GEOS' library is external to the package, and, when installing the package from source, must be correctly installed first. Windows and Mac Intel OS X binaries are provided on 'CRAN'. ('rgeos' >= 0.5-1): Up to and including 'GEOS' 3.7.1, topological operations succeeded with some invalid geometries for which the same operations fail from and including 'GEOS' 3.7.2. The 'checkValidity=' argument defaults and structure have been changed, from default FALSE to integer default '0L' for 'GEOS' < 3.7.2 (no check), '1L' 'GEOS' >= 3.7.2 (check and warn). A value of '2L' is also provided that may be used, assigned globally using 'set_RGEOS_CheckValidity(2L)', or locally using the 'checkValidity=2L' argument, to attempt zero-width buffer repair if invalid geometries are found. The previous default (FALSE, now '0L') is fastest and used for 'GEOS' < 3.7.2, but will not warn users of possible problems before the failure of topological operations that previously succeeded.
