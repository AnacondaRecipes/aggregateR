  summary: Estimation for longitudinal data following outcome dependent sampling using the sequential
    offsetted regression technique.  Includes support for binary, count, and continuous
    data.  The first regression is a logistic regression, which uses a known ratio (the
    probability of being sampled given that the subject/observation was referred divided
    by the probability of being sampled given that the subject/observation was no referred)
    as an offset to estimate the probability of being referred given outcome and covariates.  The
    second regression uses this estimated probability to calculate the mean population
    response given covariates.
