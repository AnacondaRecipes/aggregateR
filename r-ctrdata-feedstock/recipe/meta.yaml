  license: MIT
  summary: A system for querying, retrieving and analyzing protocol- and results-related information
    on clinical trials from four public registers, the 'European Union Clinical Trials
    Register' ('EUCTR', <https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/>), 'ClinicalTrials.gov'
    ('CTGOV', using the classic interface at <https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/>,
    and 'CTGOV2', using the current interface at <https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/>),
    the 'ISRCTN' (<http://www.isrctn.com/>) and the 'European Union Clinical Trials
    Information System' ('CTIS', <https://euclinicaltrials.eu/>). Trial information
    is downloaded, converted and stored in a database ('PostgreSQL', 'SQLite', 'DuckDB'
    or 'MongoDB'; via package 'nodbi'). All documents in registers associated with trials
    can also be downloaded. Other functions identify deduplicated records, easily find
    and extract variables (fields) of interest even from complex nested data as used
    by the registers, merge variables and update queries. The package can be used for
    meta-analysis and trend-analysis of the design and conduct as well as of the results
    of clinical trials.
