  summary: Provides functions for querying, retrieving and analysing protocol- and results-related
    information on clinical trials from two public registers, the European Union Clinical
    Trials Register (EUCTR, <https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/>) and ClinicalTrials.gov
    (CTGOV, <https://clinicaltrials.gov/>). The information is transformed and then
    stored in a database (mongo). Functions are provided for accessing and analysing
    the locally stored information on the clinical trials, as well as for identifying
    duplicate records. The package is motivated by the need for aggregating and trend-analysing
    the design, conduct and outcomes across clinical trials.
