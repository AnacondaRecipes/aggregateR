  summary: Dual empirical likelihood (DEL) inference under semiparametric density ratio models
    (DRM) in the presence of multiple samples, including population cumulative distribution
    function estimation, quantile estimation and comparison, density estimation, composite
    hypothesis testing for DRM parameters which encompasses testing for changes in population
    distribution functions as a special case, etc.
