  summary: The nose package consists of a collection of three functions for classifying sparseness
    in typical 2 x 2 data sets with at least one cell should have zero count. These
    functions are based on the three widely applied summary measures for 2 x 2 categorical
    data viz, Risk Difference (RD), Relative Risk (RR), Odds Ratio (OR). This package
    helps to identify suitable continuity correction for zero cells when a multi centre
    analysis or a meta analysis is carried out. Further, it can be considered as a tool
    for sensitivity analysis for adding a continuity correction and to identify the
    presence of Simpson's paradox.
