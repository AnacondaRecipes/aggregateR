  summary: This package contains functions to carry out high throughput data analysis and to
    conduct data set comparisons. Similarity matrices from high throughput phenotypic
    data containing uninformative (e.g. wild type) or missing data can be calculated
    to report similarity of response.  A suite of graph comparisons using an adjacency
    or correlation matrix format are included to facilitate quick network analysis.
