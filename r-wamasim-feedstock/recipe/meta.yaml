  summary: The outcome of various rehabilitation strategies for water distribution systems can
    be modeled with the Water Management Simulator (WaMaSim). Pipe breaks and the corresponding
    damage and rehabilitation costs are simulated. It is mainly intended to be used
    as educational tool for the Water Infrastructure Experimental and Computer Laboratory
    at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.
