  summary: Cluster analysis via nonparametric density estimation is performed. Operationally,
    the kernel method is used throughout to estimate the density. Diagnostics methods
    for evaluating the quality of the clustering are available. The package includes
    also a routine to estimate the probability density function obtained by the kernel
    method, given a set of data with arbitrary dimensions.
