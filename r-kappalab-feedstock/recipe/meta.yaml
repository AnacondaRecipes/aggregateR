  summary: "S4 tool box for capacity (or non-additive measure, fuzzy measure) and integral manipulation
    in a finite setting. It contains routines for handling various types of set functions
    such as games or capacities. It can be used to compute several non-additive integrals:
    the Choquet integral, the Sugeno integral, and the symmetric and asymmetric Choquet
    integrals. An analysis of capacities in terms of decision behavior can be performed
    through the computation of various indices such as the Shapley value, the interaction
    index, the orness degree, etc. The well-known M\uFFFDbius transform, as well as
    other equivalent representations of set functions can also be computed. Kappalab
    further contains seven capacity identification routines: three least squares based
    approaches, a method based on linear programming, a maximum entropy like method
    based on variance minimization, a minimum distance approach and an unsupervised
    approach based on parametric entropies. The functions contained in Kappalab can
    for instance be used in the framework of multicriteria decision making or cooperative
    game theory."
