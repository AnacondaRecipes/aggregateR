  summary: Functions for working with the Tracy-Widom laws and other distributions related to
    the eigenvalues of large Wishart matrices. The tables for computing the Tracy-Widom
    densities and distribution functions were computed by functions were computed by
    Momar Dieng's MATLAB package "RMLab". This package is part of a collaboration between
    Iain Johnstone, Zongming Ma, Patrick Perry, and Morteza Shahram.
