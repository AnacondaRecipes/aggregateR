  summary: ' Functions for working with the Tracy-Widom laws and other distributions  related
    to the eigenvalues of large Wishart matrices. The tables for computing the Tracy-Widom
    densities and distribution functions were computed by Momar Dieng''s MATLAB package
    "RMLab" (formerly available on his homepage at  http://math.arizona.edu/~momar/research.htm
    ). This package is part of a collaboration between Iain Johnstone,  Zongming Ma,
    Patrick Perry, and Morteza Shahram.  It will soon be replaced by a package with
    more accuracy and built-in support for relevant statistical tests.'
