  summary: 'Two distinct but related statistical approaches to the problem of identifying the
    combinations of medication error characteristics that are more likely to result
    in harm are implemented in this package: 1) a Bayesian hierarchical model with optimal
    Bayesian ranking on the log odds of harm, and 2) an empirical Bayes model that estimates
    the ratio of the observed count of harm to the count that would be expected if error
    characteristics and harm were independent. In addition, for the Bayesian hierarchical
    model, the package provides functions to assess the sensitivity of results to different
    specifications of the random effects distributions.'
