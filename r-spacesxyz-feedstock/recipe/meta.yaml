  summary: Functions for converting among CIE XYZ, xyY, Lab, and Luv. The XYZs of some standard
    illuminants and some standard linear chromatic adaptation transforms (CATs) are
    included. Compute CCT and the Planckian and daylight loci.  Three different standard
    color difference metrics are included.
