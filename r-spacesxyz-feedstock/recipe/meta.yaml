  summary: Functions for converting among CIE XYZ, xyY, Lab, and Luv. Calculate Correlated Color
    Temperature (CCT) and the Planckian and daylight loci. The XYZs of some standard
    illuminants and some standard linear chromatic adaptation transforms (CATs) are
    included. Three standard color difference metrics are included.
