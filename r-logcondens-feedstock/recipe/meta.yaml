  summary: Given independent and identically distributed observations X(1), ..., X(n), compute
    the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of a density as well as a smoothed version
    of it under the assumption that the density is log-concave, see Rufibach (2007)
    and Duembgen and Rufibach (2009). The main function of the package is 'logConDens'
    that allows computation of the log-concave MLE and its smoothed version. In addition,
    we provide functions to compute (1) the value of the density and distribution function
    estimates (MLE and smoothed) at a given point (2) the characterizing functions of
    the estimator, (3) to sample from the estimated distribution, (5) to compute a two-sample
    permutation test based on log-concave densities, (6) the ROC curve based on log-concave
    estimates within cases and controls, including confidence intervals for given values
    of false positive fractions (7) computation of a confidence interval for the value
    of the true density at a fixed point. Finally, three datasets that have been used
    to illustrate log-concave density estimation are made available.
