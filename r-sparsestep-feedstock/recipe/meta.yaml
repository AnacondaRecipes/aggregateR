  summary: Implements the SparseStep model for solving regression problems with a sparsity constraint
    on the parameters. The SparseStep regression model was proposed in Van den Burg,
    Groenen, and Alfons (2017) <arXiv:1701.06967>. In the model, a regularization term
    is added to the regression problem which approximates the counting norm of the parameters.
    By iteratively improving the approximation a sparse solution to the regression problem
    can be obtained.  In this package both the standard SparseStep algorithm is implemented
    as well as a path algorithm which uses golden section search to determine solutions
    with different values for the regularization parameter.
