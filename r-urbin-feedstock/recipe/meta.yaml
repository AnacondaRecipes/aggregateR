  summary: 'Calculate unified measures that quantify the effect of a covariate on a binary dependent
    variable (e.g., for meta-analyses). This can be particularly important if the estimation
    results are obtained with different models/estimators (e.g., linear probability
    model, logit, probit, ...) and/or with different transformations of the explanatory
    variable of interest (e.g., linear, quadratic, interval-coded, ...). The calculated
    unified measures are: (a) semi-elasticities of linear, quadratic, or interval-coded
    covariates and (b) effects of linear, quadratic, interval-coded, or categorical
    covariates when a linear or quadratic covariate changes between distinct intervals,
    the reference category of a categorical variable or the reference interval of an
    interval-coded variable needs to be changed, or some categories of a categorical
    covariate or some intervals of an interval-coded covariate need to be grouped together.
    Approximate standard errors of the unified measures are also calculated. All methods
    that are implemented in this package  are described in the ''vignette''   "Extracting
    and Unifying Semi-Elasticities and Effect Sizes from Studies with Binary Dependent
    Variables" that is included in this package.'
