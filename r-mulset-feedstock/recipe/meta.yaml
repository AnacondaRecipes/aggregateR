  summary: Computes efficient data distributions from highly inconsistent datasets with many
    missing values using multi-set intersections. Based upon hash functions, 'mulset'
    can quickly identify intersections from very large matrices of input vectors across
    columns and rows and thus provides scalable solution for dealing with missing values.
