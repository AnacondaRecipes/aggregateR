  summary: Vapor pressure, relative humidity, absolute humidity, specific humidity, and mixing
    ratio are commonly used water vapor measures in meteorology. This R package provides
    functions for calculating saturation vapor pressure (hPa), partial water vapor pressure
    (Pa), relative humidity (%), absolute humidity (kg/m^3), specific humidity (kg/kg),
    and mixing ratio (kg/kg) from temperature (K) and dew point (K). Conversion functions
    between humidity measures are also provided.
