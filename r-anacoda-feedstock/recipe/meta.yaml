  summary: 'Is a collection of models to analyze genome scale codon data using a Bayesian framework.
    Provides visualization routines and checkpointing for model fittings. Currently
    published models to analyze gene data for selection on codon usage based on Ribosome
    Overhead Cost (ROC) are: ROC (Gilchrist et al. (2015) <doi:10.1093/gbe/evv087>),
    and ROC with phi (Wallace & Drummond (2013) <doi:10.1093/molbev/mst051>). In addition
    ''AnaCoDa'' contains three currently unpublished models. The FONSE (First order
    approximation On NonSense Error) model analyzes gene data for selection on codon
    usage against of nonsense error rates. The PA (PAusing time) and PANSE (PAusing
    time + NonSense Error) models use ribosome footprinting data to analyze estimate
    ribosome pausing times with and without nonsense error rate from ribosome footprinting
    data.'
