  summary: Survey sampling using permanent random numbers (PRN's). A solution to the problem
    of unknown overlap between survey samples, which leads to a low precision in estimates
    when the survey is repeated or combined with other surveys. The PRN solution is
    to supply the U(0, 1) random numbers to the sampling procedure, instead of having
    the sampling procedure generate them. In Lindblom (2014) <doi:10.2478/jos-2014-0047>,
    and therein cited articles, it is shown how this is carried out and how it improves
    the estimates. This package supports two common fixed-size sampling procedures (simple
    random sampling and probability-proportional-to-size sampling) and includes a function
    for transforming the PRN's in order to control the sample overlap.
