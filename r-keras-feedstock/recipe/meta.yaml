  summary: Interface to 'Keras' <https://keras.io>, a high-level neural networks 'API'. 'Keras'
    was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation, supports both convolution
    based networks and recurrent networks (as well as combinations of the two), and
    runs seamlessly on both 'CPU' and 'GPU' devices.
