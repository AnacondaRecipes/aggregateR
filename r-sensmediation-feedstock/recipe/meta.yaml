  summary: We implement functions to estimate and perform sensitivity analysis to unobserved
    confounding of direct and indirect effects introduced in Lindmark, de Luna and Eriksson
    (2018) <doi:10.1002/sim.7620>. The estimation and sensitivity analysis are parametric,
    based on probit and/or linear regression models. Sensitivity analysis is implemented
    for unobserved confounding of the exposure-mediator, mediator-outcome and exposure-outcome
    relationships.
