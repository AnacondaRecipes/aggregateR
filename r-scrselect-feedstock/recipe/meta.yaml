  summary: Contains four functions used in the DIC-tau_g procedure. SCRSELECT() and SCRSELECTRUN()
    uses Stochastic Search Variable Selection to select important covariates in the
    three hazard functions of a semi-competing risks model. These functions perform
    the Gibbs sampler for variable selection and a Metropolis-Hastings-Green sampler
    for the number of split points and parameters for the three baseline hazard function.
    The function SCRSELECT() returns the posterior sample of all quantities sampled
    in the Gibbs sampler after a burn-in period to a desired file location, while the
    function SCRSELECTRUN() returns posterior values of important quantities to the
    DIC-Tau_g procedure in a list. The function DICTAUG() returns a list containing
    the DIC values for the unique models visited by the DIC-Tau_g grid search. The function
    ReturnModel() uses SCRSELECTRUN() and DICTAUG() to return a summary of the posterior
    coefficient vectors for the optimal model along with saving this posterior sample
    to a desired path location.
