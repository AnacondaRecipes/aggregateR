  summary: Generation of multiple count, binary and continuous variables simultaneously given
    the marginal characteristics and association structure. Throughout the package,
    the word 'Poisson' is used to imply count data under the assumption of Poisson distribution.
    The details of the method are explained in Amatya et al. (2015) <DOI:10.1080/00949655.2014.953534>.
