  summary: A general framework for statistical simulation, which allows researchers to make use
    of a wide range of simulation designs with minimal programming effort.  The package
    provides functionality for drawing samples from a distribution or a finite population,
    for adding outliers and missing values, as well as for visualization of the simulation
    results.  It follows a clear object-oriented design and supports parallel computing
    to increase computational performance.
