  summary: Algebraic procedures for the analysis of multiple social networks are delivered with
    this package as described in Ostoic (2020) <DOI:10.18637/jss.v092.i11>. Among other
    things, it makes it possible to create and manipulate multiplex, multimode, and
    multilevel network data with different formats. There are effective ways available
    to treat multiple networks with routines that combine algebraic systems like the
    partially ordered semigroup or the semiring structure with the relational bundles
    occurring in different types of multivariate network data sets. It also provides
    an algebraic approach for affiliation networks through Galois derivations between
    families of the pairs of subsets in the two domains.
