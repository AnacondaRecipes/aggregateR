  summary: Algebraic procedures for analyses of multiple social networks are delivered with this
    package as described in Ostoic (2020) <DOI:10.18637/jss.v092.i11>. 'multiplex' makes
    possible, among other things, to create and manipulate multiplex, multimode, and
    multilevel network data with different formats. Effective ways are available to
    treat multiple networks with routines that combine algebraic systems like the partially
    ordered semigroup with decomposition procedures or semiring structures with the
    relational bundles occurring in different types of multivariate networks. 'multiplex'
    provides also an algebraic approach for affiliation networks through Galois derivations
    between families of the pairs of subsets in the two domains of the network with
    visualization options.
