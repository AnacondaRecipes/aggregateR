  summary: Algebraic procedures for the analysis of multiple social networks are delivered with  this
    package. Among other things, it makes possible to create and manipulate multivariate  network
    data with different formats, and there are effective ways available to treat multiple  networks
    with routines that combine algebraic systems like the partially ordered semigroup
    or  the semiring structure together with the relational bundles occurring in different
    types of  multivariate network data sets. It also provides an algebraic approach
    for two-mode networks  through Galois derivations between families of the pairs
    of subsets in the two domains.
