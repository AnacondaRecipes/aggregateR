  summary: 'Efficient implementations of network science tools  to facilitate research into human
    (semantic) memory. In its current version, the package  contains several methods
    to infer networks from verbal fluency data, various network  growth models, diverse
    (switcher-) random walk processes, and tools to analyze and  visualize networks.
    To deliver maximum performance the majority of the code is written in C++. For an
    application see: Wulff, D. U., Hills, T., & Mata, R. (2018)  <doi:10.31234/osf.io/s73dp>.'
