  summary: 'Implemented are the one-sided and two-sided multiple-direction logrank test for two-sample
    right censored data. In addition to the statistics p-values are calculated: 1. For
    the one-sided testing problem one p-value based on a wild bootstrap approach is
    determined. 2. In the two-sided case one p-value based on a chi-squared approximation
    and a second p-values based on a permutation approach are calculated. Ditzhaus,
