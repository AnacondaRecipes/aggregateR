  summary: Functions for computing the penalized maximum likelihood estimate (PMLE) or maximum
    likelihood estimate (MLE), testing the order of a finite mixture model using EM-test,
    drawing histogram of observations and the fitted density or probability mass function
    of the mixture model.
