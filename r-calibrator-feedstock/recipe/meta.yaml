  summary: Performs Bayesian calibration of computer models as per Kennedy and O'Hagan 2001.  The
    package includes routines to find the hyperparameters and parameters; see the help
    page for stage1() for a worked example using the toy dataset.  A tutorial is provided
    in the calex.Rnw vignette; and a suite of especially simple one dimensional examples
    appears in inst/doc/one.dim/.
