  summary: Creates and runs Bayesian mixing models to analyze biological tracer data (i.e. stable
    isotopes, fatty acids), which estimate the proportions of source (prey) contributions
    to a mixture (consumer). 'MixSIAR' is not one model, but a framework that allows
    a user to create a mixing model based on their data structure and research questions,
    via options for fixed/ random effects, source data types, priors, and error terms.
    'MixSIAR' incorporates several years of advances since 'MixSIR' and 'SIAR'.
