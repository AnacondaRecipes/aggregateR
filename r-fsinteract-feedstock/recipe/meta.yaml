  summary: Performs fast detection of interactions in large-scale data using the method of random
    intersection trees introduced in Shah, R. D. and Meinshausen, N. (2014) <http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v15/shah14a.html>.  The
    algorithm finds potentially high-order interactions in high-dimensional binary two-class
    classification data, without requiring lower order interactions to be informative.  The
    search is particularly fast when the matrices of predictors are sparse.  It can
    also be used to perform market basket analysis when supplied with a single binary
    data matrix.  Here it will find collections of columns which for many rows contain
    all 1's.
