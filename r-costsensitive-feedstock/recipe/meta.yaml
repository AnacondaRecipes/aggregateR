  summary: Reduction-based techniques for cost-sensitive multi-class classification, in which
    each observation has a different cost for classifying it into one class, and the
    goal is to predict the class with the minimum expected cost for each new observation.
    Implements Weighted All-Pairs (Beygelzimer, A., Langford, J., & Zadrozny, B., 2008,
    <doi:10.1007/978-0-387-79361-0_1>), Weighted One-Vs-Rest (Beygelzimer, A., Dani,
    V., Hayes, T., Langford, J., & Zadrozny, B., 2005, <https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1102358>)
    and Regression One-Vs-Rest. Works with arbitrary classifiers taking observation
    weights, or with regressors. Also implements cost-proportionate rejection sampling
    for working with classifiers that don't accept observation weights.
