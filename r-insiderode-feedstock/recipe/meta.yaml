  summary: 'insideRODE package includes buildin functions from deSolve, compiled functions from
    compiler, and C/FORTRAN code interfaces to nlme. It includes nlmLSODA, nlmODE, nlmVODE,nlmLSODE
    for general purpose; cfLSODA,cfLSODE, cfODE, cfVODE call C/FORTRAN compiled dll
    functions.ver2.0 add sink()function into example it helps to directly combine c/fortran
    source code in R files. Finally, with new compiler package, we generated compiled
    functions: nlmODEcp, nlmVODEcp, nlmLSODEcp,nlmLSODAcp and cpODE, cpLSODA, cpLSODE,
    cpVODE. They will help to increase speed.'
