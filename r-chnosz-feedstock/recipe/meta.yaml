  summary: An integrated set of tools for thermodynamic calculations in aqueous geochemistry
    and geobiochemistry. Functions are provided for writing balanced reactions to form
    species from user-selected basis species and for calculating the standard molal
    properties of species and reactions, including the standard Gibbs energy and equilibrium
    constant. Calculations of the non-equilibrium chemical affinity and equilibrium
    chemical activity of species can be portrayed on diagrams as a function of temperature,
    pressure, or activity of basis species; in two dimensions, this gives a maximum
    affinity or predominance diagram. The diagrams have formatted chemical formulas
    and axis labels, and water stability limits can be added to Eh-pH, oxygen fugacity-
    temperature, and other diagrams with a redox variable. The package has been developed
    to handle common calculations in aqueous geochemistry, such as solubility due to
    complexation of metal ions, mineral buffers of redox or pH, and changing the basis
    species across a diagram ("mosaic diagrams"). CHNOSZ also implements a group additivity
    algorithm for the standard thermodynamic properties of proteins.
