  summary: Implements a segmentation algorithm for multiple change-point detection in high-dimensional
    GARCH processes. It simultaneously segments GARCH processes by identifying 'common'
    change-points, each of which can be shared by a subset or all of the component time
    series as a change-point in their within-series and/or cross-sectional correlation
    structure.
