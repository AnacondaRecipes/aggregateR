  summary: Computes classification accuracy and consistency indices under Item Response Theory.
    Implements the total score IRT-based methods in Lee, Hanson & Brennen (2002) and
    Lee (2010), the IRT-based methods in Rudner (2001, 2005), and the total score nonparametric
    methods in Lathrop & Cheng (2014). For dichotomous and polytomous tests.
