  summary: 'Algorithms for fitting free-knot splines for data with one independent variable and
    one dependent variable.  Four free-knot spline algorithms are provided for the case
    where the number of knots is known in advance.  A knot-search algorithm is provided
    for the case where the number of knots is not known in advance.  In addition, methods
    are available to compute the fitted values, the residuals, and the coefficients
    of the splines, and to plot the results, along with a method to summarize the results. '
