  summary: Network-based regularization has achieved success in variable selection for high-dimensional
    biological data due to its ability to incorporate correlations among genomic features.
    This package provides procedures of network-based variable selection for generalized
    linear models (Ren et al. (2017) <doi:10.1186/s12863-017-0495-5> and Ren et al.(2019)
    <doi:10.1002/gepi.22194>). Continuous, binary, and survival response are supported.
    Robust network-based methods are available for continuous and survival responses.
