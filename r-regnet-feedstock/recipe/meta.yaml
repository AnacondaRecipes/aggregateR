  summary: 'Network-based regularization has achieved success in variable selection for  high-dimensional
    biological data due to its ability to incorporate correlations among  genomic features.
    This package provides procedures of network-based variable selection  for generalized
    linear models (Ren et al. (2017) <doi:10.1186/s12863-017-0495-5> and  Ren et al.
    (2019) <doi:10.1002/gepi.22194>). Two recent additions are the robust network  regularization
    for the survival response and the network regularization for continuous  response.
    Functions for other regularization methods will be included in the forthcoming  upgraded
    versions. '
