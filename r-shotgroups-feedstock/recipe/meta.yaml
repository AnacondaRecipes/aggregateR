  summary: Analyzes shooting data with respect to group shape, precision, and accuracy. This
    includes graphical methods, descriptive statistics, and inference tests using standard,
    but also non-parametric and robust statistical methods. Implements distributions
    for radial error in bivariate normal variables. Works with files exported by 'OnTarget
    PC/TDS', 'Silver Mountain' e-target, 'ShotMarker' e-target, or 'Taran', as well
    as with custom data files in text format. Supports inference from range statistics
    like extreme spread. Includes a set of web-based graphical user interfaces.
