  summary: '''ODAM'' (Open Data for Access and Mining) is a framework that implements a simple
    way to make research data broadly accessible and fully available for reuse, including
    by a script language such as R. The main purpose is to make a data set accessible
    online with a minimal effort from the data provider, and to allow any scientists
    or bioinformaticians to be able to explore the data set and then extract a subpart
    or the totality of the data according to their needs. The Rodam package has only
    one class, ''odamws'', that provides methods to allow you to retrieve online data
    using ''ODAM'' Web Services. This obviously requires that data are implemented according
    the ''ODAM'' approach , namely that the data subsets were deposited in the suitable
    data repository in the form of TSV files associated with  their metadata also described  in
    TSV files. See <https://inrae.github.io/ODAM/>.'
