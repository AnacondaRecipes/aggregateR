  summary: Provides an R interface for the Pivotal Data stack running on 'PostgreSQL', 'Greenplum'
    or 'Apache HAWQ (incubating)' databases with parallel and distributed computation
    ability for big data processing. 'PivotalR' provides an R interface to various database
    operations on tables or views. These operations are almost the same as the corresponding
    native R operations. Thus users of R do not need to learn 'SQL' when they operate
    on objects in the database. It also provides a wrapper for 'Apache MADlib (incubating)',
    which is an open- source library for parallel and scalable in-database analytics.
