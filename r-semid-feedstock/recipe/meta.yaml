  summary: Provides routines to check identifiability or non-identifiability of linear structural
    equation models as described in Drton, Foygel, and Sullivant (2011) <DOI:10.1214/10-AOS859>,
    Foygel, Draisma, and Drton (2012)  <DOI:10.1214/12-AOS1012>, and other works. The
    routines are based on the graphical  representation of structural equation models
    by a path diagram/mixed graph.
