  summary: '''ViennaCL'' is a free open-source linear algebra library for computations on many-core
    architectures (GPUs, MIC) and multi-core CPUs. The library is written in C++ and
    supports ''CUDA'', ''OpenCL'', and ''OpenMP'' (including switches at runtime). I
    have placed these libraries in this package as a more efficient distribution system
    for CRAN. The idea is that you can write a package that depends on the ''ViennaCL''
    library and yet you do not need to distribute a copy of this code with your package.'
