  summary: Lights Out is a puzzle game consisting of a grid of lights that are either on or off.
    Pressing any light will toggle it and its adjacent lights. The goal of the game
    is to switch all the lights off. This package provides an interface to play the
    game on different board sizes, both through the command line or with a visual application.
    Puzzles can also be solved using the automatic solver included. View a demo online
    at http://daattali.com/shiny/lightsout/.
