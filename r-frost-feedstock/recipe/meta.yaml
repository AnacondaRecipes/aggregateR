  summary: A compilation of empirical methods used by farmers and agronomic engineers to predict
    the minimum temperature to detect a frost night. These functions use variables such
    as environmental temperature, relative humidity, and dew point. See <http://sedici.unlp.edu.ar/handle/10915/72102>
