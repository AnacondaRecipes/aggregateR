  summary: Infers a topology of relationships between different datasets, such as multi-omics
    and phenotypic data recorded on the same samples. We based this methodology on the
    RV coefficient (Robert & Escoufier, 1976, <doi:10.2307/2347233>), a measure of matrix
    correlation, which we have extended for partial matrix correlations and binary data
    (Aben et al., 2018, <doi:10.1101/293993>).
