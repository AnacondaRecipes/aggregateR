  summary: In contrast to RFC3548, the 62nd character ("+") is replaced with "-", the 63rd character
    ("/") is replaced with "_". Furthermore, the encoder does not fill the string with
    trailing "=". The resulting encoded strings comply to the regular expression pattern
    "[A-Za-z0-9_-]" and thus are safe to use in URLs or for file names. The package
    also comes with a simple base32 encoder/decoder suited for case insensitive file
    systems.
