  summary: Implementation of a model-based clustering algorithm for ranking data (C. Biernacki,
    J. Jacques (2013) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2012.08.008>). Multivariate rankings as well
    as partial rankings are taken into account. This algorithm is based on an extension
    of the Insertion Sorting Rank (ISR) model for ranking data, which is a meaningful
    and effective model parametrized by a position parameter (the modal ranking, quoted
    by mu) and a dispersion parameter (quoted by pi). The heterogeneity of the rank
    population is modelled by a mixture of ISR, whereas conditional independence assumption
    is considered for multivariate rankings.
