  summary: A dynamic programming algorithm for optimal clustering multidimensional data with
    sequential constraint. The algorithm minimizes the sum of squares of within-cluster
    distances. The sequential constraint allows only subsequent items of the input data
    to form a cluster. The sequential constraint is typically required in clustering
    data streams or items with time stamps such as video frames, GPS signals of a vehicle,
    movement data of a person, e-pen data, etc. The algorithm represents an extension
    of Ckmeans.1d.dp to multiple dimensional spaces. Similarly to the one-dimensional
    case, the algorithm guarantees optimality and repeatability of clustering. Method
    clustering.sc.dp can find the optimal clustering if the number of clusters is known.
    Otherwise, methods findwithinss.sc.dp and backtracking.sc.dp can be used.
