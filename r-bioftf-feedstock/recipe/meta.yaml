  summary: The main drawback of the most common biodiversity indices is that different measures
    may lead to different rankings among communities. This instrument overcomes this
    limit using some functional tools with the diversity profiles. In particular, the
    derivatives, the curvature, the radius of curvature, the arc length, and the surface
    area are proposed. The goal of this method is to interpret in detail the diversity
    profiles and obtain an ordering between different ecological communities on the
    basis of diversity. In contrast to the typical indices of diversity, the proposed
    method is able to capture the multidimensional aspect of biodiversity, because it
    takes into account both the evenness and the richness of the species present in
    an ecological community.
