  summary: Fits mixed membership models with discrete multivariate data (with or without repeated
    measures) following the general framework of Erosheva et al (2004). This package
    uses a Variational EM approach by approximating the posterior distribution of latent
    memberships and selecting hyperparameters through a pseudo-MLE procedure. Currently
    supported data types are Bernoulli, multinomial and rank (Plackett-Luce). The extended
    GoM model with fixed stayers from Erosheva et al (2007) is now also supported. See
    Airoldi et al (2014) for other examples of mixed membership models.
