  summary: Many inherited biases and effects exists in RNA-seq due to both biological and technical
    effects. We observed the biological variance of testing target transcripts can influence
    the yield of sequencing reads, which might indicate a resource competition existing
    in RNA-seq. We developed this package to capture the bias depending on local sequence
    and perform the correction of this type of bias by borrowing information from spike-in
    measurement.
