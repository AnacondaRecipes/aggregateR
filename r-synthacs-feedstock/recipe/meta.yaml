  license: MIT
  summary: Provides access to curated American Community Survey (ACS) base tables via a wrapper
    to library(acs). Builds synthetic micro-datasets at any user-specified geographic
    level with ten default attributes; and, conducts spatial microsimulation modeling
    (SMSM) via simulated annealing.  SMSM is conducted in parallel by default. Lastly,
    we provide functionality for data-extensibility of micro-datasets.
