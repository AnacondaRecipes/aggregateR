  summary: Provides arithmetic functions for R matrix and 'big.matrix' objects as well as functions
    for QR factorization, Cholesky factorization, General eigenvalue, and Singular value
    decomposition (SVD). A method matrix multiplication and an arithmetic method -for
    matrix addition, matrix difference- allows for mixed type operation -a matrix class
    object and a big.matrix class object- and pure type operation for two big.matrix
    class objects.
