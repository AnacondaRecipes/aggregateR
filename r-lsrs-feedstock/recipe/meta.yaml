  summary: Rapid satellite data streams in operational applications have clear benefits for monitoring
    land cover,  especially when information can be delivered as fast as changing surface
    conditions. Over the past decade, remote sensing has become a key tool for monitoring
    and predicting environmental variables by using satellite data.  This package presents
    the main applications in remote sensing for  land surface monitoring and land cover
    mapping (soil, vegetation, water...). Tomlinson, C.J., Chapman, L., Thornes, E.,
