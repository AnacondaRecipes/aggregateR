  summary: Provides tools to teach students elemental statistics. The main topics covered are
    descriptive statistics, probability models (discrete and continuous variables) and
    statistical inference (confidence intervals and hypothesis tests). One of the main
    advantages of this package is that allows the user to read quite a variety of types
    of data files with one unique command. Moreover it includes shortcuts to simple
    but up-to-now not in R descriptive features such a complete frequency table or an
    histogram with the optimal number of intervals. Related to model distributions (both
    discrete and continuous), the package allows the student to easy plot the mass/density
    function, distribution function and quantile function just detailing as input arguments
    the known population parameters. The inference related tools are basically confidence
    interval and hypothesis testing. Having defined independent commands for these two
    tools makes it easier for the student to understand what the software is performing,
    and it also helps the student to have a better knowledge on which specific tool
    they need to use in each situation. Moreover, the hypothesis testing commands provide
    not only the numeric result on the screen but also a very intuitive graph (which
    includes the statistic distribution, the observed value of the statistic, the rejection
    area and the p-value) that is very useful for the student to visualise the process.
    The regression section includes up to now, a simple linear model, with one single
    command the student can obtain the numeric summary as well as the corresponding
    diagram with the adjusted regression model and a legend with basic information (formula
    of the adjusted model and R-squared).
