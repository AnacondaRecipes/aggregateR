  summary: Tools for 3D point cloud voxelisation, projection, geometrical and morphological description
    of trees (DBH, height, volume, crown diameter), analyses of temporal changes between
    different measurement times, distance based clustering and visualisation of 3D voxel
    clouds and 2D projection. Most analyses and algorithms provided in the package are
    based on the concept of space exploration and are described in Lecigne et al. (2018,
    <doi:10.1093/aob/mcx095>).
