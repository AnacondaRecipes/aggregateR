  summary: 'Carries out analyses of two-way tables with one observation per cell, together with
    graphical displays for an additive fit and a diagnostic plot for removable ''non-additivity''
    via a power transformation of the response. It implements Tukey''s Exploratory Data

    test for row*column ''non-additivity'', linear in the row and column effects.'
