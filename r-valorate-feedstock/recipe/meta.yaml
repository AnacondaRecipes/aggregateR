  summary: The algorithm implemented in this package was designed to quickly estimates the distribution
    of the log-rank especially for heavy unbalanced groups. VALORATE estimates the null
    distribution and the p-value of the log-rank test based on a recent formulation.
    For a given number of alterations that define the size of survival groups, the estimation
    involves a weighted sum of distributions that are conditional on a co-occurrence
    term where mutations and events are both present. The estimation of conditional
    distributions is quite fast allowing the analysis of large datasets in few minutes
