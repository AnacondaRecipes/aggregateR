  summary: The functions in this package implement the safety monitoring procedures proposed
    in the paper titled "A flexible mixed effect negative binomial regression model
    for detecting unusual increases in MRI lesion counts in individual multiple sclerosis
    patients" by Kondo, Y., Zhao, Y. and Petkau, A.J. The procedure first models longitudinally
    collected count variables with a negative binomial mixed-effect regression model.
    To account for the correlation among repeated measures from the same patient, the
    model has subject-specific random intercept, which is modelled with the infinite
    mixture of Beta distributions, very flexible distribution that theoretically allows
    any form. The package also has the option of a single beta distribution for random
    effects. These mixed-effect models could be useful beyond the application of the
    safety monitoring. The inference is based on MCMC samples and this package contains
    a Gibbs sampler to sample from the posterior distribution of the negative binomial
    mixed-effect regression model. Based on the fitted model, the personalized activity
    index is computed for each patient. Lastly, this package is companion to R package
    lmeNB, which contains the functions to compute the Personalized Activity Index in
    the frequentist framework.
