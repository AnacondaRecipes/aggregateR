  summary: Organize a so-called ragged array as generalized arrays, which is simply an array
    with sub-dimensions denoting the subdivision of dimensions (grouping of members
    within dimensions). By the margins (names of dimensions and sub-dimensions) in generalized
    arrays, operators and utility functions provided in this package automatically match
    the margins, doing map-reduce style parallel computation along margins.  Generalized
    arrays are also cooperative to R's native functions that work on simple arrays.
