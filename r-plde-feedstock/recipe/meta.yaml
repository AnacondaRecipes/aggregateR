  summary: We present a penalized log-density estimation method using Legendre polynomials with
    lasso penalty to adjust estimate's smoothness. Re-expressing the logarithm of the
    density estimator via a linear combination of Legendre polynomials, we can estimate
    parameters by maximizing the penalized log-likelihood function. Besides, we proposed
    an implementation strategy that builds on the coordinate decent algorithm, together
    with the Bayesian information criterion (BIC).
