  summary: Link communities reveal the nested and overlapping structure in networks, and uncover
    the key nodes that form connections to multiple communities. linkcomm provides a
    set of tools for generating, visualizing, and analysing link communities in networks
    of arbitrary size and type. The linkcomm package also includes tools for generating,
    visualizing, and analysing Overlapping Cluster Generator (OCG) communities. Kalinka
