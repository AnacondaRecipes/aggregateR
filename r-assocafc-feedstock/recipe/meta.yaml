  summary: When doing association analysis one does not always have the genotypes for the control
    population.  In such cases it may be necessary to fall back on frequency based tests
    using well known sources for the frequencies in the control population, for instance,
    from the 1000 Genomes Project.  The Allele Frequency Comparison ('AssocAFC') package
    performs multiple rare variant association analyses in both population and family-based
    GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Study) designs. It includes three score tests that
    are based on the difference of the sum of allele frequencies between cases and controls.  Two
    of these tests, Wcorrected() and Wqls(), are collapsing-based tests and suffer from
    having protective and risk variants. The third test, afcSKAT(), is a score test
    that overcomes the mix of SNP (Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism) effect directions.
