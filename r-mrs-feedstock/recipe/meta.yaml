  summary: An implementation of the MRS algorithm for comparison across distributions, as described
    in Jacopo Soriano, Li Ma (2016) <doi:10.1111/rssb.12180>. The model is based on
    a nonparametric process taking the form of a Markov model that transitions between
    a "null" and an "alternative" state on a multi-resolution partition tree of the
    sample space. MRS effectively detects and characterizes a variety of underlying
    differences. These differences can be visualized using several plotting functions.
