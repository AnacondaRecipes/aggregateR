  summary: Ordered homogeneity pursuit lasso (OHPL) algorithm for group variable selection proposed
    in Lin et al. (2017) <DOI:10.1016/j.chemolab.2017.07.004>. The OHPL method exploits
    the homogeneity structure in high-dimensional data and enjoys the grouping effect
    to select groups of important variables automatically. This feature makes it particularly
    useful for high-dimensional datasets with strongly correlated variables, such as
    spectroscopic data.
