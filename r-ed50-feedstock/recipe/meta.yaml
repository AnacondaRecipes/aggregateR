  summary: Functions of five estimation method for ED50 (50 percent effective dose) are provided,
    and they are respectively Dixon-Mood method (1948) <doi:10.2307/2280071>, Choi's
    original turning point method (1990) <doi:10.2307/2531453> and it's modified version
    given by us, as well as logistic regression and isotonic regression. Besides, the
    package also supports comparison between two estimation results.
