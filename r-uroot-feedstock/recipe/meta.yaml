  summary: Seasonal unit roots and seasonal stability tests. P-values based on response surface
    regressions are available for both tests. P-values based on bootstrap are available
    for seasonal unit root tests. A parallel implementation of the bootstrap method
    requires a CUDA capable GPU  with compute capability >= 3.0, otherwise a debugging
    version fully coded in R is used.
