  summary: '''R'' implementation and interface of the Machine Learning platform  ''PyTorch''
    <https://pytorch.org/> developed in ''Python''. It requires a ''conda'' environment
    with ''torch'' and ''torchvision'' to provide ''PyTorch'' functions,  methods and
    classes. The key object in ''PyTorch'' is the tensor which is in essence a multidimensional
    array. These tensors are fairly flexible to perform calculations in CPUs as well
    as ''GPUs'' to accelerate the process.'
