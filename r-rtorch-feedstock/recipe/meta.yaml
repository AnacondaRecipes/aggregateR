  summary: '''R'' implementation and interface of the Machine Learning platform ''PyTorch'' <https://pytorch.org/>
    developed in ''Python''. It requires a ''conda'' environment with ''torch'' and
    ''torchvision'' Python packages to provide ''PyTorch'' functions, methods and classes.
    The key object in ''PyTorch'' is the tensor which is in essence a multidimensional
    array. These tensors are fairly flexible in performing calculations in CPUs as well
    as ''GPUs'' to accelerate tensor operations.'
