  summary: 'Two linear mixed model approaches: REML(restricted maximum likelihood) and MINQUE
    (minimum norm quadratic unbiased estimation) approaches and several resampling techniques
    are integrated for various quantitative genetics analyses. With these two types
    of approaches, various unbalanced data structures, missing data, and any irregular
    genetic  mating designs can be analyzed and statistically tested. This package also
    offers fast computations for many large data sets. Other functions will be added
    to this R tool in the future.'
