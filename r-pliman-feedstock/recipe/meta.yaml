  summary: Tools for single or batch image manipulation and analysis as described by Olivoto
    (2022) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13803> that can be used to quantify plant leaf area,
    assess disease severity, count objects, obtain shape measures, object landmarks,
    and compute Elliptical Fourier Analysis of the object outline, as described by Claude
    (2008) <doi:10.1007/978-0-387-77789-4>. Additionally, the package includes tools
    for analyzing grids, which enables high throughput field phenotyping using RGB imagery
    captured by unmanned aerial vehicles.
