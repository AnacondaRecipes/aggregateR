  summary: Building modeling packages is hard. A large amount of effort generally goes into providing
    an implementation for a new method that is efficient, fast, and correct, but often
    less emphasis is put on the user interface. A good interface requires specialized
    knowledge about S3 methods and formulas, which the average package developer might
    not have. The goal of 'hardhat' is to reduce the burden around building new modeling
    packages by providing functionality for preprocessing, predicting, and validating
    input.
