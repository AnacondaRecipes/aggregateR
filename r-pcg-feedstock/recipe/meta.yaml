  summary: The package solves linear system of equations Ax=b by using Preconditioned Conjugate
    Gradient Algorithm where A is real symmetric positive definite matrix. A suitable
    preconditioner matrix may be provided by user. This can also be used to minimize
    quadratic function (x'Ax)/2-bx for unknown x.
