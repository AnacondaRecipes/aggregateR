  summary: Implements methods for variable selection in linear regression based on the "Sum of
    Single Effects" (SuSiE) model, as described in Wang et al (2020) <DOI:10.1101/501114>
    and Zou et al (2021) <DOI:10.1101/2021.11.03.467167>. These methods provide simple
    summaries, called "Credible Sets", for accurately quantifying uncertainty in which
    variables should be selected. The methods are motivated by genetic fine-mapping
    applications, and are particularly well-suited to settings where variables are highly
    correlated and detectable effects are sparse. The fitting algorithm, a Bayesian
    analogue of stepwise selection methods called "Iterative Bayesian Stepwise Selection"
    (IBSS), is simple and fast, allowing the SuSiE model be fit to large data sets (thousands
    of samples and hundreds of thousands of variables).
