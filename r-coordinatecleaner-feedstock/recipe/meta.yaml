  summary: 'Automated flagging of common spatial and temporal errors in biological and paleontological
    collection data, for the use in conservation, ecology and paleontology. Includes
    automated tests to easily flag (and exclude) records assigned to country or province
    centroid, the open ocean, the headquarters of the Global Biodiversity Information
    Facility, urban areas or the location of biodiversity institutions (museums, zoos,
    botanical gardens, universities). Furthermore identifies per species outlier coordinates,
    zero coordinates, identical latitude/longitude and invalid coordinates. Also implements
    an algorithm to identify data sets with a significant proportion of rounded coordinates.
    Especially suited for large data sets. The reference for the methodology is: Zizka
    et al. (2019) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13152>.'
