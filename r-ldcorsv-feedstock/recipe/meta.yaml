  summary: 'Four measures of linkage disequilibrium are provided: the usual r^2 measure, the
    r^2_S measure (r^2 corrected by the structure sample), the r^2_V (r^2 corrected
    by the relatedness of genotyped individuals), the r^2_VS measure (r^2 corrected
    by both the relatedness of genotyped individuals and the structure of the sample).'
