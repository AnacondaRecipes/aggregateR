  summary: Simplifies the creation of Excel .xlsx files by providing a high level interface to
    writing, styling and editing worksheets. Through the use of 'Rcpp', read/write times
    are comparable to the 'xlsx' and 'XLConnect' packages with the added benefit of
    removing the dependency on Java.
