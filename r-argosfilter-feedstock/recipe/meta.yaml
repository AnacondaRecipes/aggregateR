  summary: Filters animal satellite tracking data obtained from the Argos system(<https://www.argos-system.org/>),
    following the algorithm described in Freitas et al (2008) <doi:10.1111/j.1748-7692.2007.00180.x>.
    It is especially indicated for telemetry studies of marine animals, where Argos
    locations are predominantly of low-quality.
