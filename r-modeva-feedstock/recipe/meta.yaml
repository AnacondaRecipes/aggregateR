  summary: Analyses species distribution models and evaluates their performance. It includes
    functions for variation partitioning, extracting variable importance, computing
    several metrics of model discrimination and calibration performance, optimizing
    prediction thresholds based on a number of criteria, performing multivariate environmental
    similarity surface (MESS) analysis, and displaying various analytical plots. Initially
    described in Barbosa et al. (2013) <doi:10.1111/ddi.12100>.
