  summary: Exact tests for Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) and Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE).
    - 2-sided LD tests based on different measures of LD (Kulinskaya and Lewin 2008)
    - 1-sided Fisher's exact test for LD - 2-sided Haldane test for HWE (Wiggington
    2005) - 1-sided test for inbreeding - conditional p-values proposed in Kulinskaya
    (2008) to overcome the problems of asymetric distributions (for both LD and HWE)
