  summary: A set of tools for determining the necessary sample size in order to identify the
    optimal dynamic treatment regime in a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized
    trial (SMART).  Utilizes multiple comparisons with the best methodology  to adjust
    for multiple comparisons. Designed for an arbitrary SMART design. Please see Artman
    (2018) <arXiv:1804.04587> for more details.
