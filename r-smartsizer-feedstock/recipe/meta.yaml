  summary: A set of tools for determining the necessary sample size in order to identify the
    optimal dynamic treatment regime in a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized
    trial (SMART). Utilizes multiple comparisons with the best methodology to adjust
    for multiple comparisons. Designed for an arbitrary SMART design. Please see Artman
    (2018) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxy064> for more details.
