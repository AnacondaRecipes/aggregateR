  summary: Total Variation Denoising is a regularized denoising method which effectively removes
    noise from piecewise constant signals whilst preserving edges.  This package contains
    a C++ implementation of Condat's very fast 1D squared error loss TVD algorithm.  Additional
    methods and loss functions may be added in future versions.
