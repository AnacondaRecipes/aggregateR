  summary: Replication Rate (RR) is the probability of replicating a statistically significant
    association in genome-wide association studies. This R-package provide the estimation
    method for replication rate which makes use of the summary statistics from the primary
    study. We can use the estimated RR to determine the sample size of the replication
    study, and to check the consistency between the results of the primary study and
    those of the replication study.
