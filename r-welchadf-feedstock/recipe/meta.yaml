  summary: Implementation of Johansen's general formulation of Welch-James's statistic with Approximate
    Degrees of Freedom, which makes it suitable for testing  any linear hypothesis concerning
    cell means in univariate and multivariate mixed model designs when the data pose
    non-normality and non-homogeneous variance. Some  improvements, namely trimmed means
    and Winsorized variances, and bootstrapping for calculating an empirical critical
    value, have been added to the classical formulation.  The code departs from a previous
    SAS implementation by L.M. Lix and H.J. Keselman, available at <http://supp.apa.org/psycarticles/supplemental/met_13_2_110/SAS_Program.pdf>
    and published in Keselman, H.J., Wilcox, R.R., and Lix, L.M. (2003) <DOI:10.1111/1469-8986.00060>.
