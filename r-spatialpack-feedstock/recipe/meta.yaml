  summary: 'Tools to assess the association between two spatial processes. Currently, several
    methodologies are implemented: A modified t-test to perform hypothesis testing about
    the independence between the processes, a suitable nonparametric correlation coefficient,
    the codispersion coefficient, and an F test for assessing the multiple correlation
    between one spatial process and several others. Functions for image processing and
    computing the spatial association between images are also provided. SpatialPack
    gives methods to complement methodologies that are available in geoR for one spatial
    process.'
