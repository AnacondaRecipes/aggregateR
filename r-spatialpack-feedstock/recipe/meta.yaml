  summary: 'Tools to assess the association between two spatial processes. Currently, several
    methodologies are implemented: A modified t-test to perform hypothesis testing about
    the independence between the processes, a suitable nonparametric correlation coefficient,
    the codispersion coefficient, and an F test for assessing the multiple correlation
    between one spatial process and several others. Functions for image processing and
    computing the spatial association between images are also provided.'
