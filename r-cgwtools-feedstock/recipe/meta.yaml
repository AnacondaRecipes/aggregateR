  summary: Functions for performing quick observations or evaluations of data, including a variety
    of ways to list objects by size, class, etc. In addition, functions which mimic
    Unix shell commands, including 'head', 'tail' ,'pushd' ,and 'popd'. The functions
    'seqle' and 'reverse.seqle' mimic the base 'rle' but can search for linear sequences.
    The function 'splatnd' allows the user to generate zero-argument commands without
    the need for 'makeActiveBinding' .
