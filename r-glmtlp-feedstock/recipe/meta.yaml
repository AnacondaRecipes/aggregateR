  summary: It provides an extremely efficient procedure for fitting the entire truncated lasso
    regularization path for linear regression, logistic and multinomial regression models,
    Poisson regression and the Cox model. The algorithm uses the difference of convex
    technique. The detail of the algorithm is described in Shen, Pan and Zhu (2012)
    <doi:10.1080/01621459.2011.645783>. The package is inherited from a popular R package
    'glmnet' and many functions in 'glmnet' can be directly used in 'glmtlp'. You can
    learn more details by the online manual (<http://wuchong.org/glmtlp.html>).
