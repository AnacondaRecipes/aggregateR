  summary: A set of functions to build simple  GUI controls for R functions.  These are built
    on the 'tcltk' package.  Uses could include changing a parameter on a graph by animating
    it  with a slider or a "doublebutton", up to more sophisticated control  panels.
    Some functions for specific graphical tasks, referred to as 'cartoons', are provided.
