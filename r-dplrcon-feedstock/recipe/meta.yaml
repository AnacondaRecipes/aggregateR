  summary: 'The concordance method is a non-parametric method based on bootstrapping that is
    used to test the hypothesis that two subsets of time series are similar in terms
    of mean, variance or both. This method was developed to address a concern within
    dendroclimatology that young trees may produce a differing climate response to older
    more established trees. Details of this method are available in  Pirie, M. (2013).

    also produces a figure with 3 panels, each panel is for a different climate variable.
