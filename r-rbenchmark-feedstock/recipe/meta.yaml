  summary: rbenchmark is inspired by the Perl module Benchmark, and is intended to facilitate
    benchmarking of arbitrary R code. The library consists of just one function, benchmark,
    which is a simple wrapper around system.time.  Given a specification of the benchmarking
    process (counts of replications, evaluation environment) and an arbitrary number
    of expressions, benchmark evaluates each of the expressions in the specified environment,
    replicating the evaluation as many times as specified, and returning the results
    conveniently wrapped into a data frame.
