  summary: Google's Compact Language Detector 3 is a neural network model for language identification
    and the successor of 'cld2' (available from CRAN). The algorithm is still experimental
    and takes a novel approach to language detection with different properties and outcomes.
    It can be useful to combine this with the Bayesian classifier results from 'cld2'.
    See <https://github.com/google/cld3#readme> for more information.
