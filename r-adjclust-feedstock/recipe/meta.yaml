  summary: Implements a constrained version of hierarchical agglomerative  clustering, in which
    each observation is associated to a position, and  only adjacent clusters can be
    merged. Typical application fields in  bioinformatics include Genome-Wide Association
    Studies or Hi-C data  analysis, where the similarity between items is a decreasing
    function of  their genomic distance. Taking advantage of this feature, the implemented  algorithm
    is time and memory efficient. This algorithm is described in  Chapter 4 of Alia
    Dehman (2015)  <https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01288568v1>.
