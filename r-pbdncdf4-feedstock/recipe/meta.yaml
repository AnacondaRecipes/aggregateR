  summary: This package adds collective parallel read and write capability to the R package ncdf4
    version 1.8. Typical use is as a parallel NetCDF4 file reader in SPMD style programming.
    Each R process reads and writes its own data in a synchronized collective mode,
    resulting in faster parallel performance. Performance improvement is conditional
    on a parallel file system.
