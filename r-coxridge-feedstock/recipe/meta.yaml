  summary: 'A package for fitting Cox models with penalized ridge-type partial likelihood. The
    package includes functions for fitting simple Cox models with all covariates controlled
    by a ridge penalty. The weight of the penalty is optimised by using a REML type-algorithm.
    Models with time varying effects of the covariates can also be fitted. Some of the
    covariates may be allowed to be fixed and thus not controlled by the penalty. There
    are three different penalty functions, ridge, dynamic and weighted dynamic. Time
    varying effects can be fitted without the need of an expanded dataset. '
