  summary: The package can identify the dysregulated KEGG pathways based on global influence
    from the internal effect of pathways and crosstalk between pathways. (1) The PAGI
    package can prioritize the pathways associated with two biological states by statistical
    significance or FDR. (2) The PAGI package can evaluated the global influence factor
    (GIF) score in the global gene-gene network constructed based on the relationships
    of genes extracted from each pathway in KEGG database and the overlapped genes between
    pathways.
