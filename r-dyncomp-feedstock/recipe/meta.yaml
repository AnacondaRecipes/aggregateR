  summary: 'While there are many well-established measures for identifying critical fluctuations
    and phase transitions, these measures only work with many points of measurement
    and thus are unreliable when studying short and coarse-grained time series. This
    package provides a measure for complexity in a time series that does not rely on
    long time series (Kaiser (2017), <doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/GWTKX>). '
