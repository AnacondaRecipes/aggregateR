  summary: 'Prior transcription factor binding knowledge and target gene expression data are
    integrated in a Bayesian framework for functional cis-regulatory module inference.
    Using Gibbs sampling, we iteratively estimate transcription factor associations
    for each gene, regulation strength for each binding event and the hidden activity
    for each transcription factor.  '
