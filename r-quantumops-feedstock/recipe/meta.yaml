  summary: Contains basic structures and operations used frequently in quantum computing. Intended
    to be a convenient tool to help learn quantum mechanics and algorithms. Can create
    arbitrarily sized kets and bras and implements quantum gates, inner products, and
    tensor products. Creates arbitrarily controlled versions of all gates and can simulate
    complete or partial measurements of kets. Has functionality to convert functions
    into equivalent quantum gates. Includes larger applications, such as Steane error
    correction <DOI:10.1103/physrevlett.77.793>, Quantum Fourier Transform and Shor's
    algorithm (Shor 1999), Grover's algorithm (1996), Quantum Approximation Optimization
    Algorithm (QAOA) (Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann 2014) <arXiv:1411.4028>, and a variational
    quantum classifier (Schuld 2018) <arXiv:1804.00633>.
