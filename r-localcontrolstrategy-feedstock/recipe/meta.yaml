  summary: Especially when cross-sectional data are observational, effects of treatment selection
    bias and confounding are revealed by using the Nonparametric and Unsupervised "preprocessing"
    methods central to Local Control (LC) Strategy. The LC objective is to estimate
    the "effect-size distribution" that best quantifies a potentially causal relationship
    between a numeric y-Outcome variable and a t-Treatment variable. This t-variable
    may be either binary {1 = "new" vs 0 = "control"} or a numeric measure of Exposure
    level. LC Strategy starts by CLUSTERING experimental units (patients) on their pre-exposure
    X-Covariates, forming mutually exclusive and exhaustive BLOCKS of relatively well-matched
    units. The implicit statistical model for LC is thus simple one-way ANOVA. The Within-Block
    measures of effect-size are Local Rank Correlations (LRCs) when Exposure is numeric
    with more than two levels. Otherwise, Treatment choice is Nested within BLOCKS,
    and effect-sizes are LOCAL Treatment Differences (LTDs) between within-cluster y-Outcome
    Means ["new" minus "control"]. An Instrumental Variable (IV) method is also provided
    so that Local Average y-Outcomes (LAOs) within BLOCKS may also contribute information
    for effect-size inferences ...assuming that X-Covariates influence only Treatment
    choice or Exposure level and otherwise have no direct effects on y-Outcome. Finally,
    a "Most-Like-Me" function provides histograms of effect-size distributions to aid
    Doctor-Patient communications about Personalized Medicine.
