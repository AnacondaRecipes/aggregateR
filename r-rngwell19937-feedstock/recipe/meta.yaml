  summary: Long period linear random number generator WELL19937a by F. Panneton, P. L'Ecuyer
    and M. Matsumoto. The initialization algorithm allows to seed the generator with
    a numeric vector of an arbitrary length and uses MRG32k5a by P. L'Ecuyer to achieve
    good quality of the initialization. The output function may be set to provide numbers
    from the interval (0,1) with 53 (the default) or 32 random bits. WELL19937a is of
    similar type as Mersenne Twister and has the same period. WELL19937a is slightly
    slower than Mersenne Twister, but has better equidistribution and "bit-mixing" properties
    and faster recovery from states with prevailing zeros than Mersenne Twister. All
    WELL generators with orders 512, 1024, 19937 and 44497 can be found in randtoolbox
    package.
