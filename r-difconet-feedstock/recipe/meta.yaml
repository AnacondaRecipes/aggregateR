  summary: Estimation of DIFferential COexpressed NETworks using diverse and user metrics. This
    package is basically used for three functions related to the estimation of differential
    coexpression. First, to estimate differential coexpression where the coexpression
    is estimated, by default, by Spearman correlation. For this, a metric to compare
    two correlation distributions is needed. The package includes 6 metrics. Some of
    them needs a threshold. A new metric can also be specified as a user function with
    specific parameters (see difconet.run). The significance is be estimated by permutations.
    Second, to generate datasets with controlled differential correlation data. This
    is done by either adding noise, or adding specific correlation structure. Third,
    to show the results of differential correlation analyses. Please see <http://bioinformatica.mty.itesm.mx/difconet>
    for further information.
