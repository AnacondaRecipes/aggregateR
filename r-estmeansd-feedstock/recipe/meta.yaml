  summary: Implements the methods of McGrath et al. (2020) <doi:10.1177/0962280219889080> and
    Cai et al. (2021) <doi:10.1177/09622802211047348> for estimating the sample mean
    and standard deviation from commonly reported quantiles in meta-analysis. These
    methods can be applied to studies that report the sample median, sample size, and
    one or both of (i) the sample minimum and maximum values and (ii) the first and
    third quartiles.
