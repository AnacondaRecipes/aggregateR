  summary: An implementation of the fractional weighted bootstrap to be used as a drop-in for
    functions in the 'boot' package. The fractional weighted bootstrap (also known as
    the Bayesian bootstrap) involves drawing weights randomly that are applied to the
    data rather than resampling units from the data. See Xu et al. (2020) <doi:10.1080/00031305.2020.1731599>
    for details.
