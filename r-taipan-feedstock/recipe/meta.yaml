  summary: A tool to help create shiny apps for selecting and annotating  elements of images.
    Users must supply images, questions, and answer choices. The user interface is a
    dynamic shiny app, that displays the images and questions and answer choices. The
    data generated can be saved to a file that can be used for subsequent analysis.
    The original purpose was to annotate still images from tennis video for face recognition
    and emotion  detection purposes.
